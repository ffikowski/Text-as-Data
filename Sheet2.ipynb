      " Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.  For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more  than any other time of year. For another, he really  wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in  secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to  be a wizard.   It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his  stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his  head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large  leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda  Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry  moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page,  frowning as he looked for something that would help  him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth  Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.”   The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking  paragraph. Harry pushed his round glasses up the  bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the  book, and read Non-magic people (more commonly known as  Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval  times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare  occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard,  burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard  would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and  then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a  gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird  enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed  herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in  various disguises.   Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached  underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of  parchment. Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed  the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to  write, pausing every now and then to listen, because  if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill  on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find  himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for  the rest of the summer.   The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was  the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer  holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their son,  Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were  Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude  toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had been a  witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned  under the Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and  Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as  downtrodden as possible, they would be able to  squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had  been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of  anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the  last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to  lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, an broomstick at the start of the summer break, and  forbid him to talk to the neighbors.   This separation from his spellbooks had been a real  problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts  had given him a lot of holiday work. One of the  essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking  potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher,  Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an  excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry had  therefore seized his chance in the first week of the  holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and  Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire  Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices,  so that the rest of the street would notice it too),   Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the  cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his  books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as  he didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the  Dursleys need never know that he was studying  magic by night.   Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his  aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already  in an especially bad mood with him, all because he’d  received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one  week into the school vacation.   Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at  Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. This  meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn’t, but  had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily it  had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.   “Vernon Dursley speaking.”   Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time,  froze as he heard Ron’s voice answer “HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT —  TO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!”   Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped  and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring  at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm.   “WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the  mouthpiece. “WHO ARE YOU?”   “RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he  and Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends  of a football field. “I’M — A — FRIEND — OF —  HARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL — ”   Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry,  who was rooted to the spot.   “THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared,  now holding the receiver at arm’s length, as though  frightened it might explode. “I DONT KNOW WHAT  SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER  CONTACT ME AGAIN! DONT YOU COME NEAR MY  FAMILY!”   And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as  if dropping a poisonous spider.   The fight that had followed had been one of the worst  ever.   “HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE  LIKE — PEOPLE LIKE YOU!” Uncle Vernon had  roared, spraying Harry with spit.   Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into  trouble, because he hadn’t called again. Harry’s other  best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn’t  been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron ha warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity,  because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s  year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to  use a telephone, and would probably have had  enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.   So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding  friends for five long weeks, and this summer was  turning out to be almost as bad as the last one. There  was just one very small improvement — after  swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to  any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his  owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in  because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked  in her cage all the time.   Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and  paused to listen again. The silence in the dark house  was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his  enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late, Harry  thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness.   Perhaps he’d finish this essay tomorrow night. ...   He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old  pillowcase from under his bed; put the flashlight, A  History of Magic, his essay, quill, and ink inside it; got  out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard  under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and  checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his  bedside table.   It was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach  gave a funny jolt. He had been thirteen years old,  without realizing it, for a whole hour.   Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little  he looked forward to his birthdays. He had never  received a birthday card in his life. The Dursleys ha completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had  no reason to suppose they would remember this one.   Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s  large, empty cage, to the open window. He leaned on  the sill, the cool night air pleasant on his face after a  long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been  absent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried  about her: she’d been gone this long before. But he  hoped she’d be back soon — she was the only living  creature in this house who didn’t flinch at the sight of  him.   Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his  age, had grown a few inches over the last year. His  jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had  been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The  eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his  forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin  scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.   Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was  the most extraordinary of all. It was not, as the  Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of  the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because  Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash.  They had been murdered, murdered by the most  feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord  Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack  with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where  Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had  rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive,   Voldemort had fled. ...   But Harry had come face-to-face with him at  Hogwarts. Remembering their last meeting as he  stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was  lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig,  perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse  dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing  absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before  Harry realized what he was seeing.   Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing  larger every moment, was a large, strangely lopsided  creature, and it was flapping in Harry’s direction. He  stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For  a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window  latch, wondering whether to slam it shut. But then  the bizarre creature soared over one of the street  lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it  was, leapt aside.   Through the window soared three owls, two of them  holding up the third, which appeared to be  unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on  Harry’s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and  gray, keeled right over and lay motionless. There was  a large package tied to its legs.   Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his  name was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley  family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords  around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then  carried Errol to Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one  bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to  gulp some water.   Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of  them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig.  She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked extremely  pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate  nip with her beak as he removed her burden, then  flew across the room to join Errol Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome  tawny one, but he knew at once where it had come  from, because in addition to a third package, it was  carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When  Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its  feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off  through the window into the night.   Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s  package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a  present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday  card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the  envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a  newspaper clipping.   The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding  newspaper, the Daily Prophet, because the people in  the black-and-white picture were moving. Harry  picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:   Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts  Office at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual  Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw.   A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, “We  will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in  Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse  breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank. ”   The Weasley family will be spending a month in  Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year  at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children  currently attend Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin  spread across his face as he saw all nine of the  Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of  a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall,  balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all  (though the black-and-white picture didn’t show it)  with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the  picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat,  Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his  little sister, Ginny.   Harry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a  large pile of gold more than the Weasleys, who were  very nice and extremely poor. He picked up Ron’s  letter and unfolded it.   Dear Harry,   Happy birthday!   Look, I’m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope  the Muggles didn’t give you a hard time. I asked Dad,  and he reckons I shouldn’t have shouted.   It’s amazing here in Egypt. Bill’s taken us around all  the tombs and you wouldn’t believe the curses those  old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn’t let  Ginny come in the last one. There were all these  mutant skeletons in there, of Muggles who’d broken in  and grown extra heads and stuff.   I couldn’t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet  Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it’s gone on  this trip, but they’re going to buy me a new wand for  next year.   Harry remembered only too well the occasion when  Ron’s old wand had snapped. It had happened whe the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts  had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.   We’ll be back about a week before term starts and  we’ll be going up to London to get my wand and our  new books. Any chance of meeting you there?   Don’t let the Muggles get you down!   Try and come to London,   Ron   PS. Percy’s Head Boy. He got the letter last week.   Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who  was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, was  looking particularly smug. He had pinned his Head  Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his  neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the  Egyptian sun.   Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it.  Inside was what looked like a miniature glass  spinning top. There was another note from Ron  beneath it.   Harry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s  someone untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light  up and spin. Bill says it’s rubbish sold for wizard  tourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at  dinner last night. But he didn’t realize Fred and George  had put beetles in his soup.   Bye —   Ro Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside  table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point,  reflecting the luminous hands of his clock. He looked  at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the  parcel Hedwig had brought.   Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card,  and a letter, this time from Hermione.   Dear Harry,   Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to  your Uncle Vernon. I do hope you’re all right.   I’m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn’t  know how I was going to send this to you — what if  they’d opened it at customs? — but then Hedwig  turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got  something for your birthday for a change. I bought your  present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in  the Daily Prophet (I’ve been getting it delivered; it’s so  good to keep up with what’s going on in the wizarding  world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a  week ago? I bet he’s learning loads. I’m really jealous  — the ancient Egyptian wizards were fascinating.   There’s some interesting local history of witchcraft  here, too. I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic  essay to include some of the things I’ve found out. I  hope it’s not too long — it’s two rolls of parchment more  than Professor Binns asked for.   Ron says he’s going to be in London in the last week of  the holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and  uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If not, I’ll see  you on the Hogwarts Express on September first!   Love fro Hermion PS. Ron says Percy’s Head Boy. I’ll bet Percy’s really  pleased.   Ron doesn’t seem too happy about it.   Harry laughed as he put Hermione ’s letter aside and  picked up her present. It was very heavy. Knowing  Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book full of  very difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a  huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a  sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped  across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit.   “Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the  case to look inside.   There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish  Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig  Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom  for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself  Broomcare.   Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed  most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most  popular sport in the magical world — highly  dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks.  Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player;  he had been the youngest person in a century to be  picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of  Harry’s most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two  Thousand racing broom.   Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his  last parcel. He recognized the untidy scrawl on the  brown paper at once: this was from Hagrid, the  Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of  paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly, the parcel  gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it  snapped loudly — as though it had jaws.   Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send  him anything dangerous on purpose, but then,   Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of what  was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend  giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from  men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his  cabin.   Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly  again. Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside  table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over  his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of  the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.   And out fell — a book. Harry just had time to register  its handsome green cover, emblazoned with the  golden title The Monster Book of Monsters, before it  flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the  bed like some weird crab.   “Uh-oh,” Harry muttered.   The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and  shuffled rapidly across the room. Harry followed it  stealthily. The book was hiding in the dark space  under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still  fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees  and reached toward it.   “Ouch!”   The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped  past him, still scuttling on its covers. Harry  scrambled around, threw himself forward, an managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud,  sleepy grunt in the room next door.   Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry  clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms,  hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled out a belt,  which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book  shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap,  so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for  Hagrid’s card.   Dear Harry,   Happy birthday!   Think you might find this useful for next year.   Won’t say no more here. Tell you when I see you.   Hope the Muggles are treating you right.   All the best,   Hagrid   It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a  biting book would come in useful, but he put Hagrid’s  card up next to Ron’s and Hermione’s, grinning more  broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from  Hogwarts left.   Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry  slit open the envelope, pulled out the first page of  parchment within, and read:   Dear Mr. Potter,   Please note that the new school year will begin on  September the first. The Hogwarts Express will leav from King’s Cross station, platform nine and three-  quarters, at eleven o’clock.   Third years are permitted to visit the village of  Hogsmeade on certain weekends. Please give the  enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to  sign.   A list of books for next year is enclosed.   Yours sincerely,   Professor M. McGonagall  Deputy Headmistress   Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and  looked at it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful  to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an  entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot  there. But how on earth was he going to persuade  Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form?   He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two  o’clock in the morning.   Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form  when he woke up, Harry got back into bed and  reached up to cross off another day on the chart he’d  made for himself, counting down the days left until  his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses  and lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday  cards.   Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment  Harry Potter felt just like everyone else — glad, for the  first time in his life, that it was his birthday AUNT MARGE’S Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to  find the three Dursleys already sitting around the  kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new  television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present  for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly about  the long walk between the fridge and the television in  the living room. Dudley had spent most of the  summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on  the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate  continually.   Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a  large, beefy man with very little neck and a lot of  mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy birthday,  none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had  noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far too  used to this to care. He helped himself to a piece of  toast and then looked up at the reporter on the  television, who was halfway through a report on an  escaped convict \"... The public is warned that Black is armed and  extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set  up, and any sighting of Black should be reported  immediately.”   “No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle  Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the  prisoner. “Look at the state of him, the filthy  layabout! Look at his hair!”   He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy  hair had always been a source of great annoyance to  Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on the  television, however, whose gaunt face was  surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry  felt very well groomed indeed.   The reporter had reappeared.   “The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will  announce today — ”   “Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at  the reporter. “You didn’t tell us where that maniac’s  escaped from! What use is that? Lunatic could be  coming up the street right now!”   Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced,  whipped around and peered intently out of the  kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would  simply love to be the one to call the hot line number.  She was the nosiest woman in the world and spent  most of her life spying on the boring, law-abiding  neighbors.   “When will they learn,” said Uncle Vernon, pounding  the table with his large purple fist, “that hanging’s the  only way to deal with these people? “Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still  squinting into next door’s runner beans.   Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his  watch, and added, “I’d better be off in a minute,  Petunia. Marge’s train gets in at ten.”   Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the  Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth  with an unpleasant bump.   “Aunt Marge?” he blurted out. “Sh — she’s not  coming here, is she?”   Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s sister. Even though  she was not a blood relative of Harry’s (whose mother  had been Aunt Petunia’s sister), he had been forced to  call her “Aunt” all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the  country, in a house with a large garden, where she  bred bulldogs. She didn’t often stay at Privet Drive,  because she couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs,  but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in  Harry’s mind.   At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had  whacked Harry around the shins with her walking  stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musical  statues. A few years later, she had turned up at  Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and  a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the  year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had  accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog.  Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up  a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off  until past midnight. The memory of this incident still  brought tears of laughter to Dudley’s eyes.   “Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled,  “and while we’re on the subject” — he pointed a fa finger threateningly at Harry — “we need to get a few  things straight before I go and collect her.”   Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the  television. Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle  Vernon was Dudley’s favorite form of entertainment.   “Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil  tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.”   “All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s  talking to me.”   “Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he  had not heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know  anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any —  any funny stuff while she’s here. You behave yourself,  got me?”   “I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth.   “And thirdly,” said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes  now slits in his great purple face, “we’ve told Marge  you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably  Criminal Boys.”   “What?” Harry yelled.   “And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be  trouble,” spat Uncle Vernon.   Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at  Uncle Vernon, hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge  coming for a week-long visit — it was the worst  birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him,  including that pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks “Well, Petunia,” said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to  his feet, “111 be off to the station, then. Want to come  along for the ride, Dudders?”   “No,” said Dudley, whose attention had returned to  the television now that Uncle Vernon had finished  threatening Harry.   “Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,”  said Aunt Petunia, smoothing Dudley’s thick blond  hair. “Mummy’s bought him a lovely new bow tie.”   Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder.   “See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the  kitchen.   Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified  trance, had a sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he  got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to  the front door.   Uncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.   “I’m not taking you,” he snarled as he turned to see  Harry watching him.   “Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly. “I want to  ask you something.”   Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.   “Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to  visit the village sometimes,” said Harry.   “So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from  a hook next to the door “I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry  in a rush.   “And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon.   “Well,” said Harry, choosing his words carefully, “it’ll  be hard work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that  St. Whatsits — ”   “St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal  Boys!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased  to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon’s  voice.   “Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle  Vernon’s large, purple face. “It’s a lot to remember. I’ll  have to make it sound convincing, won’t I? What if I  accidentally let something slip?”   “ You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?”  roared Uncle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist  raised. But Harry stood his ground.   “Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt  Marge forget what I could tell her,” he said grimly.   Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an  ugly puce.   “But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on  quickly, “I swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to  go to school, and I’ll act like a Mug — like I’m normal  and everything.”   Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it  over, even if his teeth were bared and a vein was  throbbing in his temple “Right,” he snapped finally. “I shall monitor your  behavior carefully during Marge’s visit. If, at the end  of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll  sign your ruddy form.”   He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and  slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of  glass at the top fell out.   Harry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back  upstairs to his bedroom. If he was going to act like a  real Muggle, he’d better start now. Slowly and sadly  he gathered up all his presents and his birthday  cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with  his homework. Then he went to Hedwig’s cage. Errol  seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both  asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then  poked them both awake.   “Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’re going to have to  clear off for a week. Go with Errol. Ron’ll look after  you. I’ll write him a note, explaining. And don’t look at  me like that” — Hedwig’s large amber eyes were  reproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll  be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and  Hermione.”   Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note  to Ron bound to her leg) soared out of the window  and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly  miserable, put the empty cage away inside the  wardrobe.   But Harry didn’t have long to brood. In next to no  time, Aunt Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for  Harry to come down and get ready to welcome their  guest “Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia  snapped as he reached the hall.   Harry couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair  lie flat. Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the  untidier he looked, the happier she would be.   All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as  Uncle Vernon’s car pulled back into the driveway,  then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the  garden path.   “Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.   A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled  the door open.   On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like  Uncle Vernon: large, beefy, and purple-faced, she  even had a mustache, though not as bushy as his. In  one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked  under the other was an old and evil-tempered  bulldog.   “Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s  my neffy-poo?”   Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair  plastered flat to his fat head, a bow tie just visible  under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust the  suitcase into Harry’s stomach, knocking the wind out  of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and  planted a large kiss on his cheek.   Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up  with Aunt Marge’s hugs because he was well paid for  it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley  had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist “Petunia!” shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as  though he was a hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt  Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her  large jaw against Aunt Petunia’s bony cheekbone.   Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut  the door.   “Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?”   “Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said  Aunt Marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen,  leaving Harry alone in the hall with the suitcase. But  Harry wasn’t complaining; any excuse not to be with  Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the  case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long  as he could.   By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge  had been supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper  was lapping noisily in the corner. Harry saw Aunt  Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool  flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.   “Who’s looking after the other dogs, Marge?” Uncle  Vernon asked.   “Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,”  boomed Aunt Marge. “He’s retired now, good for him  to have something to do. But I couldn’t leave poor old  Ripper. He pines if he’s away from me.”   Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This  directed Aunt Marge’s attention to Harry for the first  time.   “So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?”   “Yes,” said Harry “Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt  Marge growled. “It’s damn good of Vernon and  Petunia to keep you. Wouldn’t have done it myself.  You’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d  been dumped on my doorstep.”   Harry was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an  orphanage than with the Dursleys, but the thought of  the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He forced his face  into a painful smile.   “Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. “I can  see you haven’t improved since I last saw you. I hoped  school would knock some manners into you.” She  took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and  said, “Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?”   “St. Brutus’s,” said Uncle Vernon promptly. “It’s a  first-rate institution for hopeless cases.”   “I see,” said Aunt Marge. “Do they use the cane at St.  Brutus’s, boy?” she barked across the table.   “Er —  Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s  back.   “Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do  the thing properly, he added, “all the time.”   “Excellent,” said Aunt Marge. “I won’t have this  namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not  hitting people who deserve it. A good thrashing is  what’s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.  Have you been beaten often?”   “Oh, yeah,” said Harry, “loads of times. Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes “I still don’t like your tone, boy,” she said. “If you can  speak of your beatings in that casual way, they  clearly aren’t hitting you hard enough. Petunia, I’d  write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the  use of extreme force in this boy’s case.”   Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might  forget their bargain; in any case, he changed the  subject abruptly.   “Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about  that escaped prisoner, eh?”   As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry  caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at  number four without her. Uncle Vernon and Aunt  Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their  way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt  Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her  eye at all times, so that she could boom out  suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in  comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge  pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while  glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he  hadn’t got a present too. She also kept throwing out  dark hints about what made Harry such an  unsatisfactory person.   “You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s  turned out, Vernon,” she said over lunch on the third  day. “If there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s  nothing anyone can do about it.”   Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands  shook and his face was starting to burn with anger.  Remember the form, he told himself. Think about  Hogsmeade. Don’t say anything. Don’t rise  Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine “It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You  see it all the time with dogs. If there’s something  wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong  with the pup — ”   At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was  holding exploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in  every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and  blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.   “Marge!” squealed Aunt Petunia. “Marge, are you all  right?”   “Not to worry,” grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face  with her napkin. “Must have squeezed it too hard. Did  the same thing at Colonel Fubster’s the other day. No  need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip ...”   But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both  looking at Harry suspiciously, so he decided he’d  better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon  as he could.   Outside in the hall, he leaned against the wall,  breathing deeply. It had been a long time since he’d  lost control and made something explode. He couldn’t  afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form  wasn’t the only thing at stake — if he carried on like  that, he’d be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.   Harry was still an underage wizard, and he was  forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school.  His record wasn’t exactly clean either. Only last  summer he’d gotten an official warning that had  stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of  any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face  expulsion from Hogwarts He heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried  upstairs out of the way.   Harry got through the next three days by forcing  himself to think about his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself  Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on him. This  worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a  glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the  opinion that he was mentally subnormal.   At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge’s stay  arrived. Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and  Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles of wine. They  got all the way through the soup and the salmon  without a single mention of Harry’s faults; during the  lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all  with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making  company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle  Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.   “Can I tempt you, Marge?”   Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her  huge face was very red.   “Just a small one, then,” she chuckled. “A bit more  than that ... and a bit more ... that’s the ticket.”   Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt  Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger  sticking out. Harry really wanted to disappear into his  bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon’s angry little eyes  and knew he would have to sit it out.   “Aah,” said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and  putting the empty brandy glass back down. “Excellent  nosh, Petunia. It’s normally just a fry-up for me of an  evening, with twelve dogs to look after. ...” She  burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach “Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,”  she went on, winking at Dudley. “You’ll be a proper-  sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I’ll have a  spot more brandy, Vernon. ...”   “Now, this one here — ”   She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach  clench. The Handbook, he thought quickly.   “This one’s got a mean, runty look about him. You get  that with dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last  year. Ratty little thing it was. Weak. Underbred.”   Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his  book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers.   “It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other  day. Bad blood will out. Now, I’m saying nothing  against your family, Petunia” — she patted Aunt  Petunia’s bony hand with her shovellike one — “but  your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best  families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here’s  the result right in front of us.”   Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his  ears. Grasp your broom firmly by the tail, he thought.  But he couldn’t remember what came next. Aunt  Marge’s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of  Uncle Vernon’s drills.   “This Potter,” said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the  brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and  over the tablecloth, “you never told me what he did?”   Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking  extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his  pie to gape at his parents “He — didn’t work,” said Uncle Vernon, with half a  glance at Harry. “Unemployed. “As I expected!” said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig  of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. “A no-  account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who — ”   “He was not,” said Harry suddenly. The table went  very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never  felt so angry in his life.   “MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone  very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge’s  glass. “You, boy,” he snarled at Harry. “Go to bed, go  on —  “No, Vernon,” hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a  hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry’s. “Go  on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They  go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I  expect) — ”   “They didn’t die in a car crash!” said Harry, who  found himself on his feet.   “They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left  you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking  relatives!” screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury.  “You are an insolent, ungrateful little — ”   But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a  moment, it looked as though words had failed her.   She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger —  but the swelling didn’t stop. Her great red face started  to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth  stretched too tightly for speech — next second,  several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket  and pinged off the walls — she was inflating like a  monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of he tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a  salami —   “MARGE!” yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia  together as Aunt Marge’s whole body began to rise off  her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round,  now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her  hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up  into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper  came skidding into the room, barking madly.   “NOOOOOOO!”   Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge’s feet and tried to  pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the  floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and  sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon’s leg.   Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could  stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs.  The cupboard door burst magically open as he  reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the  front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself  under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard,  and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and  birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig’s  empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his  trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining  room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.   “COME BACK IN HERE!” he bellowed. “COME BACK  AND PUT HER RIGHT!”   But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked  his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at  Uncle Vernon.   “She deserved it,” Harry said, breathing very fast.   “She deserved what she got. You keep away from me. He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door “I’m going,” Harry said. “I’ve had enough.”   And in the next moment, he was out in the dark,  quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him,  Hedwig’s cage under his arm  Harry was several streets away before he collapsed  onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from  the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still,  anger still surging through him, listening to the  frantic thumping of his heart.   But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new  emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he  looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was  stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with  absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he  had just done serious magic, which meant that he  was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had  broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage  Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic  representatives weren’t swooping down on him where  he sat.   Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia  Crescent. What was going to happen to him? Would  he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from  the wizarding world? He thought of Ron an Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was  sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would  want to help him now, but they were both abroad,  and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting  them.   He didn’t have any Muggle money, either. There was a  little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of  his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had  left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding  Bank in London. He’d never be able to drag his trunk  all the way to London. Unless ...   He looked down at his wand, which he was still  clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his  heart was now thumping painfully fast), a bit more  magic couldn’t hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he  had inherited from his father — what if he bewitched  the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his  broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to  London? Then he could get the rest of his money out  of his vault and ... begin his life as an outcast. It was  a horrible prospect, but he couldn’t sit on this wall  forever, or he’d find himself trying to explain to  Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night  with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.   Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the  contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak —  but before he had found it, he straightened up  suddenly, looking around him once more.   A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made  Harry feel he was being watched, but the street  appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from  any of the large square houses.   He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately  stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or  something was standing in the narrow gap between  the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted  at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he’d  know whether it was just a stray cat or — something  else.   “Lumos,” Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the  end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high  over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number  two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and  between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking  outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming  eyes.   Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and  he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung  out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in  the gutter —   There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his  hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding  light —   With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in  time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and  headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry  had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw  when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently  purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold  lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus.   For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been  knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple  uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak  loudly to the night.   “Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for  the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out you wand hand, step on board, and we can take you  anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike,  and I will be your conductor this eve — ”   The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught  sight of Harry, who was still sitting on the ground.  Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to  his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was  only a few years older than he was, eighteen or  nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and  quite a few pimples.   “What were you doin’ down there?” said Stan,  dropping his professional manner.   “Fell over,” said Harry.   “ ’Choo fall over for?” sniggered Stan.   “I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed. One  of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he  had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He  suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and  turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway  between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus’s  headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was  empty.   “ ’Choo lookin’ at?” said Stan.   “There was a big black thing,” said Harry, pointing  uncertainly into the gap. “Like a dog ... but massiv He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly  open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan’s eyes  move to the scar on Harry’s forehead.   “Woss that on your ’ead?” said Stan abruptly “Nothing,” said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over  his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him,  he didn’t want to make it too easy for them.   “Woss your name?” Stan persisted.   “Neville Longbottom,” said Harry, saying the first  name that came into his head. “So — so this bus,” he  went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, “did you say  it goes anywhere?”   “Yep,” said Stan proudly, “anywhere you like, long’s  it’s on land. Can’t do nuffink underwater. ’Ere,” he  said, looking suspicious again, “you did flag us down,  dincha? Stuck out your wand ’and, dincha?”   “Yes,” said Harry quickly. “Listen, how much would it  be to get to London?”   “Eleven Sickles,” said Stan, “but for firteen you get ’ot  chocolate, and for fifteen you get an ’ot water bottle  an’ a toofbrush in the color of your choice.”   Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted  his money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan’s  hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with  Hedwig’s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the  bus.   There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass  bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows.  Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed,  illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in  a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, “Not now,  thanks, I’m pickling some slugs” and rolled over in his  sleep.   “You ’ave this one,” Stan whispered, shoving Harry’s  trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who wa sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel.  “This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This is Neville  Longbottom, Ern.”   Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick  glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his  bangs again and sat down on his bed.   “Take ’er away, Ern,” said Stan, sitting down in the  armchair next to Ernie’s.   There was another tremendous BANG, and the next  moment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown  backward by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling  himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and  saw that they were now bowling along a completely  different street. Stan was watching Harry’s stunned  face with great enjoyment.   “This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he  said. “Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?”   “Ar,” said Ernie.   “How come the Muggles don’t hear the bus?” said  Harry.   “Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don’ listen  properly, do they? Don’ look properly either. Never  notice nuffink, they don’.”   “Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,” said Ern.  “Well be in Abergavenny in a minute.”   Stan passed Harry’s bed and disappeared up a  narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out  of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie  didn’t seem to have mastered the use of a steering  wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement but it didn’t hit anything; lines of lampposts,  mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it  approached and back into position once it had  passed.   Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly  green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak.   “ ’Ere you go, Madam Marsh,” said Stan happily as  Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or  so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh  clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered  down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and  rammed the doors shut; there was another loud  BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow  country lane, trees leaping out of the way.   Harry wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if he had  been traveling on a bus that didn’t keep banging  loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His  stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what  was going to happen to him, and whether the  Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the  ceiling yet.   Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and  was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A  large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long,  matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front  page. He looked strangely familiar.   “That man!” Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a  moment. “He was on the Muggle news!”   Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.   “Sirius Black,” he said, nodding. “ ’Course ’e was on  the Muggle news, Neville, where you been? He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look  on Harry’s face, removed the front page, and handed  it to Harry.   “You oughta read the papers more, Neville.”   Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:  Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner  ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding  capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today.   “We are doing all we can to recapture Black,” said the  Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning,   “and we beg the magical community to remain calm.”   Fudge has been criticized by some members of the  International Federation of Warlocks for informing the  Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis.   “Well, really, I had to, don’t you know,” said an  irritable Fudge. “Black is mad. He’s a danger to  anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the  Prime Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a  word of Black’s true identity to anyone. And let’s face  it — who’d believe him if he did?”   While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a  gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill  each other), the magical community lives in fear of a  massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black  murdered thirteen people with a single curse Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black,  the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen  pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts  classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked  just like one.   “Scary-lookin’ fing, inee?” said Stan, who had been  watching Harry read.   “He murdered thirteen people?” said Harry, handing  the page back to Stan, “with one curse?”   “Yep,” said Stan, “in front of witnesses an’ all. Broad  daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?”   “Ar,” said Ern darkly.   Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back,  the better to look at Harry.   “Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-’Oo,” he said.   “What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking.   Even Stan’s pimples went white; Ern jerked the  steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to  jump aside to avoid the bus.   “You outta your tree?” yelped Stan. “ ’Choo say ’is  name for?”   “Sorry,” said Harry hastily. “Sorry, I — I forgot — ”   “Forgot!” said Stan weakly. “Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’  that fast...”   “So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?”  Harry prompted apologetically “Yeah,” said Stan, still rubbing his chest. “Yeah,  that’s right. Very close to You-Know-’Oo, they say.  Anyway, when little ’Arry Potter got the better of You-  Know-’Oo — ”   Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again.   “ — all You-Know-’Oo’s supporters was tracked down,  wasn’t they, Ern? Most of ’em knew it was all over,  wiv You-Know-’Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not  Sirius Black. I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in-  command once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over.   “Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street  full of Muggles an’ Black took out ’is wand and ’e  blasted ’alf the street apart, an’ a wizard got it, an’ so  did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. ’Orrible, eh?  An’ you know what Black did then?” Stan continued  in a dramatic whisper.   “What?” said Harry.   “Laughed,” said Stan. “Jus’ stood there an’ laughed.  An’ when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic  got there, ’e went wiv ’em quiet as anyfink, still  laughing ’is ’ead off. ’Cos ’e’s mad, inee, Ern? Inee  mad?”   “If he weren’t when he went to Azkaban, he will be  now,” said Ern in his slow voice. “I’d blow meself up  before I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind  you ... after what he did. ...”   “They ’ad a job coverin’ it up, din’ they, Ern?” Stan  said. “ ’Ole street blown up an’ all them Muggles  dead. What was it they said ’ad ’appened, Ern?”   “Gas explosion,” grunted Ernie “An’ now ’e’s out,” said Stan, examining the  newspaper picture of Black’s gaunt face again. “Never  been a breakout from Azkaban before, ’as there, Ern?  Beats me ’ow ’e did it. Frightenin’, eh? Mind, I don’t  fancy ’is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh,  Ern?”   Ernie suddenly shivered.   “Talk about summat else, Stan, there’s a good lad.  Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.”   Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry  leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling  worse than ever. He couldn’t help imagining what  Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights’  time.   “ ’Ear about that ’Arry Potter? Blew up ’is aunt! We  ’ad ’im ’ere on the Knight Bus, di’n’t we, Ern? ’E was  tryin’ to run for it. ...”   He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius  Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land  him in Azkaban? Harry didn’t know anything about  the wizard prison, though everyone he’d ever heard  speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the  Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there  only last year. Harry wouldn’t soon forget the look of  terror on Hagrid ’s face when he had been told where  he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest  people Harry knew.   The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness,  scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone  booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and  miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan  remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate,  but poured it all over Harry’s pillow when the bu moved abruptly from Anglesey to Aberdeen. One by  one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and  slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the  bus. They all looked very pleased to go.   Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.   “Right then, Neville,” said Stan, clapping his hands,  “whereabouts in London?”   “Diagon Alley,” said Harry.   “Righto,” said Stan. “ ’Old tight, then ...”   BANG!   They were thundering along Charing Cross Road.  Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches  squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus’s way.   The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low  for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it  opened, then set off — where, he didn’t know.   Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus  skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby-  looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay  the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.   “Thanks,” Harry said to Ern.   He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his  trunk and Hedwig’s cage onto the pavement.   “Well,” said Harry. “ ’Bye then!”   But Stan wasn’t paying attention. Still standing in the  doorway to the bus, he was goggling at the shadowy  entrance to the Leaky Cauldron “ There you are, Harry,” said a voice Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his  shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, “Blimey!  Ern, come ’ere! Come ’ere!”   Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his  shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his  stomach — he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge,  the Minister of Magic himself.   Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.   “What didja call Neville, Minister?” he said excitedly.   Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak,  looked cold and exhausted.   “Neville?” he repeated, frowning. “This is Harry  Potter.”   “I knew it!” Stan shouted gleefully. “Ern! Ern! Guess  ’oo Neville is, Ern! ’E’s ’Arry Potter! I can see ’is scar!”   “Yes,” said Fudge testily, “well, I’m very glad the  Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to  step inside the Leaky Cauldron now ...”   Fudge increased the pressure on Harry’s shoulder,  and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub.  A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through  the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened,  toothless landlord.   “You’ve got him, Minister!” said Tom. “Will you be  wanting anything? Beer? Brandy?”   “Perhaps a pot of tea,” said Fudge, who still hadn’t let  go of Harry There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind  them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry’s  trunk and Hedwig’s cage and looking around  excitedly.   “ ’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, Neville?”  said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie’s owlish face  peered interestedly over Stan’s shoulder.   “And a private parlor, please, Tom,” said Fudge  pointedly.   “ ’Bye,” Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom  beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the  bar.   “ ’Bye, Neville!” called Stan.   Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after  Tom’s lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom  clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate,  and he bowed himself out of the room.   “Sit down, Harry,” said Fudge, indicating a chair by  the fire.   Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his  arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his  pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up  the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down  opposite Harry.   “I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.”   Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen  Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his  father’s Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn’t to  know that Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over  his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets.  He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and  Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind  him.   “Well, Harry,” said Fudge, pouring out tea, “you’ve  had us all in a right flap, I don’t mind telling you.  Running away from your aunt and uncle’s house like  that! I’d started to think ... but you’re safe, and that’s  what matters.”   Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the  plate toward Harry.   “Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then ...  You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with  the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley.  Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad  were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss  Dursley has been punctured and her memory has  been modified. She has no recollection of the incident  at all. So that’s that, and no harm done.”   Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup,  rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew.  Harry, who couldn’t believe his ears, opened his  mouth to speak, couldn’t think of anything to say,  and closed it again.   “Ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt  and uncle?” said Fudge. “Well, I won’t deny that they  are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to  take you back next summer as long as you stay at  Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.”   Harry unstuck his throat “I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and  Easter holidays,” he said, “and I don’t ever want to go  back to Privet Drive.”   “Now, now, I’m sure you’ll feel differently once you’ve  calmed down,” said Fudge in a worried tone. “They  are your family, after all, and I’m sure you are fond of  each other — er — very deep down.”   It didn’t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was  still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him  now.   “So all that remains,” said Fudge, now buttering  himself a second crumpet, “is to decide where you’re  going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation. I  suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron  and — ”   “Hang on,” blurted Harry. “What about my  punishment?”   Fudge blinked.   “Punishment?”   “I broke the law!” Harry said. “The Decree for the  Restriction of Underage Wizardry!”   “Oh, my dear boy, we’re not going to punish you for a  little thing like that!” cried Fudge, waving his crumpet  impatiently. “It was an accident! We don’t send people  to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!”   But this didn’t tally at all with Harry’s past dealings  with the Ministry of Magic.   “Last year, I got an official warning just because a  house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle’s house! he told Fudge, frowning. “The Ministry of Magic said  I’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more  magic there!”   Unless Harry’s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was  suddenly looking awkward.   “Circumstances change, Harry. ... We have to take  into account ... in the present climate . . . Surely you  don’t want to be expelled?”   “Of course I don’t,” said Harry.   “Well then, what’s all the fuss about?” laughed Fudge.  “Now, have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if  Tom’s got a room for you.”   Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after  him. There was something extremely odd going on.  Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky  Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he’d done?  And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn’t  usual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved  in matters of underage magic?   Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the  innkeeper.   “Room eleven’s free, Harry,” said Fudge. “I think you’ll  be very comfortable. Just one thing, and I’m sure  you’ll understand ... I don’t want you wandering off  into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon Alley.  And you’re to be back here before dark each night.  Sure you’ll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on  you for me.”   “Okay,” said Harry slowly, “but why — ? “Don’t want to lose you again, do we?” said Fudge  with a hearty laugh. “No, no ... best we know where  you are. ... I mean ...”   Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his  pinstriped cloak.   “Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know. ...”   “Have you had any luck with Black yet?” Harry asked.   Fudge’s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his  cloak.   “What’s that? Oh, you’ve heard — well, no, not yet,  but it’s only a matter of time. The Azkaban guards  have never yet failed ... and they are angrier than I’ve  ever seen them.”   Fudge shuddered slightly.   “So, I’ll say good-bye.”   He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a  sudden idea.   “Er — Minister? Can I ask you something?”   “Certainly,” said Fudge with a smile.   “Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit  Hogsmeade, but my aunt and uncle didn’t sign the  permission form. D’you think you could — ?”   Fudge was looking uncomfortable.   “Ah,” he said. “No, no, I’m very sorry, Harry, but as  I’m not your parent or guardian —  “But you’re the Minister of Magic,” said Harry eagerly.  “If you gave me permission — ”   “No, I’m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,” said Fudge  flatly. “Perhaps you’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next  year. In fact, I think it’s best if you don’t ... yes ...  well, I’ll be off. Enjoy your stay, Harry.”   And with a last smile and shake of Harry’s hand,  Fudge left the room. Tom now moved forward,  beaming at Harry.   “If you’ll follow me, Mr. Potter,” he said, “I’ve already  taken your things up. ...”   Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase  to a door with a brass number eleven on it, which  Tom unlocked and opened for him.   Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some  highly polished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling  fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe —   “Hedwig!” Harry gasped.   The snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down  onto Harry’s arm.   “Very smart owl you’ve got there,” chuckled Tom.  “Arrived about five minutes after you did. If there’s  anything you need, Mr. Potter, don’t hesitate to ask.”   He gave another bow and left.   Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly  stroking Hedwig. The sky outside the window was  changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue to cold,  steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold.  Harry could hardly believe that he’d left Privet Driv only a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and  that he was now facing three Dursley-free weeks “It’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,” he yawned.   And without even removing his glasses, he slumped  back onto his pillows and fell asleep It took Harry several days to get used to his strange  new freedom. Never before had he been able to get up  whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He  could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was  in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was  packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in  the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to  Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.   Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky  Cauldron, where he liked watching the other guests:  funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s  shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the  latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking  warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked  suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw  liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.   After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard,  take out his wand, tap the third brick from the left  above the trash bin, and stand back as the archway  into Diagon Alley opened in the wall Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops  and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas  outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing  one another their purchases (“it’s a lunascope, old  boy — no more messing around with moon charts,  see?”) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black  (“personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone  until he’s back in Azkaban”). Harry didn’t have to do  his homework under the blankets by flashlight  anymore; now he could sit in the bright sunshine  outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor,  finishing all his essays with occasional help from  Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart from knowing a  great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry  free sundaes every half an hour.   Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold  Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his  vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self-  control not to spend the whole lot at once. He had to  keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at  Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys  for money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying  a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding  game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a  nasty-smelling liquid into the other player’s face when  they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the  perfect, moving model of the galaxy in a large glass  ball, which would have meant he never had to take  another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested  Harry’s resolution most appeared in his favorite shop,  Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he’d arrived  at the Leaky Cauldron.   Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was  staring at, Harry edged his way inside and squeezed  in among the excited witches and wizards until he  glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which wa mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever  seen in his life.   “Just come out — prototype — ” a square-jawed  wizard was telling his companion.   “It’s the fastest broom in the world, isn’t it, Dad?”  squeaked a boy younger than Harry, who was  swinging off his father’s arm.   “Irish International Side’s just put in an order for  seven of these beauties!” the proprietor of the shop  told the crowd. “And they’re favorites for the World  Cup!”   A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was  able to read the sign next to the broom:   This state-of-the-art racing broom sports a stream-  lined, superfine handle of ash, treated with a  diamond-hard polish and hand-numbered with its  own registration number. Each individually selected  birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to  aerodynamic perfection, giving the Firebolt  unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision. The  Firebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in  ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable  Braking Charm. Price on request.   Price on request ... Harry didn’t like to think how  much gold the Firebolt would cost. He had never  wanted anything as much in his whole life — but he  had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two  Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his  Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very  good broom already? Harry didn’t ask for the price but he returned, almost every day after that, just to  look at the Firebolt.   There were, however, things that Harry needed to  buy. He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store  of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were  now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he  visited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and  bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to  buy his new schoolbooks, which would include those  for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures  and Divination.   Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop  window. Instead of the usual display of gold-  embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there  was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about  a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters.  Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books  grappled with each other, locked together in furious  wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.   Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and  consulted it for the first time. The Monster Book of  Monsters was listed as the required book for Care of  Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid  had said it would come in useful. He felt relieved; he  had been wondering whether Hagrid wanted help with  some terrifying new pet.   As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager  came hurrying toward him.   “Hogwarts?” he said abruptly. “Come to get your new  books?”   “Yes,” said Harry, “I need —  “Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently,  brushing Harry aside. He drew on a pair of very thick  gloves, picked up a large, knobbly walking stick, and  proceeded toward the door of the Monster Books’ cage.   “Hang on,” said Harry quickly, “I’ve already got one of  those.”   “Have you?” A look of enormous relief spread over the  manager’s face. “Thank heavens for that. I’ve been  bitten five times already this morning — ”   A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster  Books had seized a third and were pulling it apart.   “Stop it! Stop it!” cried the manager, poking the  walking stick through the bars and knocking the  books apart. “I’m never stocking them again, never!   It’s been bedlam! I thought we’d seen the worst when  we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of  Invisibility — cost a fortune, and we never found  them. ... Well ... is there anything else I can help you  with?”   “Yes,” said Harry, looking down his booklist, “I need  Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.”   “Ah, starting Divination, are you?” said the manager,  stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the  back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to  fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with  volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate  Yourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When  Fortunes Turn Foul.   “Here you are,” said the manager, who had climbed a  set of steps to take down a thick, black-bound book.  “Unfogging the Future. Very good guide to all you basic fortune-telling methods — palmistry, crystal  balls, bird entrails — ”   But Harry wasn’t listening. His eyes had fallen on  another book, which was among a display on a small  table: Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the  Worst Is Coming.   “Oh, I wouldn’t read that if I were you,” said the  manager lightly, looking to see what Harry was  staring at. “You’ll start seeing death omens  everywhere. It’s enough to frighten anyone to death.”   But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the  book; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with  gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar. ...   The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into  Harry’s hands.   “Anything else?” he said.   “Yes,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the  dog’s and dazedly consulting his booklist. “Er — I  need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard  Book of Spells, Grade Three.”   Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes  later with his new books under his arms and made  his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing  where he was going and bumping into several people.   He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside,  and tipped his books onto his bed. Somebody had  been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was  pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by  in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the  sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He  caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin “It can’t have been a death omen,” he told his  reflection defiantly. “I was panicking when I saw that  thing in Magnolia Crescent. ... It was probably just a  stray dog. ...”   He raised his hand automatically and tried to make  his hair lie flat.   “You’re fighting a losing battle there, dear,” said his  mirror in a wheezy voice.   As the days slipped by, Harry started looking  wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione.   Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon  Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met  Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow  Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where  they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the  real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy,  outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn’t stop to chat;  Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was  being told off by his very formidable-looking  grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that  he’d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the  Ministry of Magic.   Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking  that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione  tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up,  dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was  just wondering where he’d have lunch, when someone  yelled his name and he turned.   “Harry! HARRY!”   They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean  Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron looking  incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving  frantically at him “Finally!” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down.  “We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d  left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam  Malkin’s, and — ”   “I got all my school stuff last week,” Harry explained.  “And how come you knew I’m staying at the Leaky  Cauldron?”   “Dad,” said Ron simply.   Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic,  would of course have heard the whole story of what  had happened to Aunt Marge.   “Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?” said  Hermione in a very serious voice.   “I didn’t mean to,” said Harry while Ron roared with  laughter. “I just — lost control.”   “It’s not funny, Ron,” said Hermione sharply.  “Honestly, I’m amazed Harry wasn’t expelled.”   “So am I,” admitted Harry. “Forget expelled, I thought  I was going to be arrested.” He looked at Ron. “Your  dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he?”   “Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it?” shrugged Ron, still  chuckling. “Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate  to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an  aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first,  because Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can  ask Dad yourself this evening. We’re staying at the  Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to  King’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as  well! Hermione nodded, beaming. “Mum and Dad dropped  me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.”   “Excellent!” said Harry happily. “So, have you got all  your new books and stuff?”   “Look at this,” said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of  a bag and opening it. “Brand-new wand. Fourteen  inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And  we’ve got all our books — ” He pointed at a large bag  under his chair. “What about those Monster Books,  eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we  wanted two.”   “What’s all that, Hermione?” Harry asked, pointing at  not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to  her.   “Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t  I?” said Hermione. “Those are my books for  Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination,  Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies — ”   “What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said Ron,  rolling his eyes at Harry. “You’re Muggle-born! Your  mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all  about Muggles!”   “But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the  wizarding point of view,” said Hermione earnestly.   “Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year,  Hermione?” asked Harry, while Ron sniggered.  Hermione ignored them.   “I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she said, checking her  purse. “It’s my birthday in September, and Mum and  Dad gave me some money to get myself an early  birthday present. “How about a nice book?” said Ron innocently.   “No, I don’t think so,” said Hermione composedly. “I  really want an owl. I mean, Harry’s got Hedwig and  you’ve got Errol — ”   “I haven’t,” said Ron. “Errol’s a family owl. All I’ve got  is Scabbers.” He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket.  “And I want to get him checked over,” he added,  placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. “I  don’t think Egypt agreed with him.”   Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there  was a definite droop to his whiskers.   “There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said  Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. “You  could see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and  Hermione can get her owl.”   So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street  to the Magical Menagerie.   There wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall  was hidden by cages. It was smelly and very noisy  because the occupants of these cages were all  squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The  witch behind the counter was already advising a  wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry,  Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.   A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly  and feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise  with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the  window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly  up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit  kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with  a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every  color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funn custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly,  and on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats  that were playing some sort of skipping game using  their long, bald tails.   The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron  approached the counter.   “It’s my rat,” he told the witch. “He been a bit off-color  ever since I brought him back from Egypt.”   “Bang him on the counter,” said the witch, pulling a  pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket.   Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and  placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats, who  stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire  for a better look.   Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat  was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron’s  brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy  rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.   “Hm,” said the witch, picking up Scabbers. “How old  is this rat?”   “Dunno,” said Ron. “Quite old. He used to belong to  my brother.”   “What powers does he have?” said the witch,  examining Scabbers closely.   “Er — ” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown  the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch’s  eyes moved from Scabbers ’s tattered left ear to his  front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted  loudly “He’s been through the mill, this one,” she said “He was like that when Percy gave him to me,” said  Ron defensively.   “An ordinary common or garden rat like this can’t be  expected to live longer than three years or so,” said  the witch. “Now, if you were looking for something a  bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these — ”   She indicated the black rats, who promptly started  skipping again. Ron muttered, “Show-offs.”   “Well, if you don’t want a replacement, you can try  this rat tonic,” said the witch, reaching under the  counter and bringing out a small red bottle.   “Okay,” said Ron. “How much — OUCH!”   Ron buckled as something huge and orange came  soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on  his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at  Scabbers.   “NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!” cried the witch, but  Scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of  soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then  scampered for the door.   “Scabbers!” Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after  him; Harry followed.   It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers,  who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside  Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling  rat back into his pocket and straightened up,  massaging his head.   “What was that? “It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,”  said Harry.   “Where’s Hermione?”   “Probably getting her owl — ”   They made their way back up the crowded street to  the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione  came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her arms  were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.   “You bought that monster?” said Ron, his mouth  hanging open.   “He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.   That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The  cat’s ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was  definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy  and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong  into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight,  however, the cat was purring contentedly in  Hermione ’s arms.   “Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.   “He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said  Hermione.   “And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the  lump in his chest pocket. “He needs rest and  relaxation! How’s he going to get it with that thing  around?”   “That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,” said  Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron’s  hand. “And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be  sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours what’s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch  said he’d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.”   “I wonder why,” said Ron sarcastically as they set off  toward the Leaky Cauldron.   They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the  Daily Prophet.   “Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up. “How are  you?”   “Fine, thanks,” said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione  joined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping.   Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the  now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him.   “They still haven’t caught him, then?” he asked.   “No,” said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave.  “They’ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the  Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far.”   “Would we get a reward if we caught him?” asked  Ron. “It’d be good to get some more money — ”   “Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on  closer inspection looked very strained. “Black’s not  going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It’s  the Azkaban guards who’ll get him back, you mark  my words.”   At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden  with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred  and George, who were about to start their fifth year at  Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the  Weasleys’ youngest child and only girl, Ginny Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry,  seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual  when she saw him, perhaps because he had saved  her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She  went very red and muttered “hello” without looking at  him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as  though he and Harry had never met and said, “Harry.  How nice to see you.”   “Hello, Percy,” said Harry, trying not to laugh.   “I hope you’re well?” said Percy pompously, shaking  hands. It was rather like being introduced to the  mayor.   “Very well, thanks — ”   “Harry!” said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and  bowing deeply. “Simply splendid to see you, old boy  “Marvelous,” said George, pushing Fred aside and  seizing Harry’s hand in turn. “Absolutely spiffing.”   Percy scowled.   “That’s enough, now,” said Mrs. Weasley.   “Mum!” said Fred as though he’d only just spotted her  and seizing her hand too. “How really corking to see  you — ”   “I said, that’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley, depositing  her shopping in an empty chair. “Hello, Harry, dear. I  suppose you’ve heard our exciting news?” She pointed  to the brand-new silver badge on Percy’s chest.  “Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling  with pride “And last,” Fred muttered under his breath “I don’t doubt that,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning  suddenly. “I notice they haven’t made you two  prefects.”   “What do we want to be prefects for?” said George,  looking revolted at the very idea. “It’d take all the fun  out of life.”   Ginny giggled.   “You want to set a better example for your sister!”  snapped Mrs. Weasley.   “Ginny’s got other brothers to set her an example,  Mother,” said Percy loftily. “I’m going up to change for  dinner. ...”   He disappeared and George heaved a sigh.   “We tried to shut him in a pyramid,” he told Harry.  “But Mum spotted us.”   Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the  innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and  the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their  way through five delicious courses.   “How’re we getting to King’s Cross tomorrow, Dad?”  asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate  pudding.   “The Ministry’s providing a couple of cars,” said Mr.  Weasley.   Everyone looked up at him.   “Why?” said Percy curiously “It’s because of you, Perce,” said George seriously.  “And there’ll be little flags on the hoods, with HB on  them — ”   “ — for Humongous Bighead,” said Fred.   Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into  their pudding.   “Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?” Percy  asked again, in a dignified voice.   “Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mr.  Weasley, “ — and as I work there, they’re doing me a  favor — ”   His voice was casual, but Harry couldn’t help noticing  that Mr. Weasley’s ears had gone red, just like Ron’s  did when he was under pressure.   “Good thing, too,” said Mrs. Weasley briskly. “Do you  realize how much luggage you’ve all got between you?  A nice sight you’d be on the Muggle Underground. ...  You are all packed, aren’t you?”   “Ron hasn’t put all his new things in his trunk yet,”  said Percy, in a long-suffering voice. “He’s dumped  them on my bed.”   “You’d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we  won’t have much time in the morning,” Mrs. Weasley  called down the table. Ron scowled at Percy.   After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by  one they made their way upstairs to their rooms to  check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy  were next door to Harry. He had just closed and  locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices  through the wall, and went to see what was going on The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was  shouting.   “It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for  polishing — ”   “I haven’t touched it, all right?” Ron roared back.  “What’s up?” said Harry.   “My Head Boy badge is gone,” said Percy, rounding on  Harry.   “So’s Scabbers’s rat tonic,” said Ron, throwing things  out of his trunk to look. “I think I might’ve left it in  the bar — ”   “You’re not going anywhere till you’ve found my  badge!” yelled Percy.   “I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed,” Harry said to  Ron, and he went downstairs.   Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar,  which was now very dark, when he heard another  pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second  later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasleys’.  He hesitated, not wanting them to know he’d heard  them arguing, when the sound of his own name made  him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.   “... makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was  saying heatedly. “Harry’s got a right to know. I’ve tried  to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a  child. He’s thirteen years old and — ”   “Arthur, the truth would terrify him!” said Mrs.  Weasley shrilly. “Do you really want to send Harr back to school with that hanging over him? For  heaven’s sake, he’s happy not knowing!”   “I don’t want to make him miserable, I want to put  him on his guard!” retorted Mr. Weasley. “You know  what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by  themselves — they’ve even ended up in the Forbidden  Forest! But Harry mustn’t do that this year! When I  think what could have happened to him that night he  ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn’t picked  him up, I’m prepared to bet he would have been dead  before the Ministry found him.”   “But he’s not dead, he’s fine, so what’s the point — ”   “Molly, they say Sirius Black’s mad, and maybe he is,  but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban,  and that’s supposed to be impossible. It’s been a  month, and no one’s seen hide nor hair of him, and I  don’t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet,  we’re no nearer catching Black than inventing self-  spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is  what Black’s after — ”   “But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.”   “We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can  break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.”   “But no one’s really sure that Black’s after Harry — ”   There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr.  Weasley had banged his fist on the table.   “Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They  didn’t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it  kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night  Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Black’s  been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always th same words: ‘He’s at Hogwarts ... he’s at Hogwarts.’  Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If  you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring  You-Know-Who back to power. Black lost everything  the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he’s had  twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that. ...”   There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the  door, desperate to hear more.   “Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right.  But you’re forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don’t think  anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while  Dumbledore ’s headmaster. I suppose he knows about  all this?”   “Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds  the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the  entrances to the school grounds. He wasn’t happy  about it, but he agreed.”   “Not happy? Why shouldn’t he be happy, if they’re  there to catch Black?”   “Dumbledore isn’t fond of the Azkaban guards,” said  Mr. Weasley heavily. “Nor am I, if it comes to that ...  but when you’re dealing with a wizard like Black, you  sometimes have to join forces with those you’d rather  avoid.”   “If they save Harry — ”   “ — then I will never say another word against them,”  said Mr. Weasley wearily. “It’s late, Molly, we’d better  go up. ...”   Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he  hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight.  The parlor door opened, and a few seconds late footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were  climbing the stairs The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they  had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr.  and Mrs. Weasley’s bedroom door close, then headed  back upstairs with the bottle.   Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on  the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to  Percy dismantling his and Ron’s room in search of his  badge.   “We’ve got it,” Fred whispered to Harry. “We’ve been  improving it.”   The badge now read BigheacL Boy.   Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic,  then shut himself in his room and lay down on his  bed.   So Sirius Black was after him. This explained  everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because  he was so relieved to find him alive. He’d made Harry  promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were  plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was  sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the  station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look  after Harry until he was on the train.   Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door  and wondered why he didn’t feel more scared. Sirius  Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse;  Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously thought Harry would  be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry  happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley  that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus  Dumbledore happened to be. Didn’t people always sa that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort  had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort’s  right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?   And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone  kept talking about. They seemed to scare most people  senseless, and if they were stationed all around the  school, Black’s chances of getting inside seemed very  remote.   No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was  the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now  looked like zero. Nobody would want Harry to leave  the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in  fact, Harry suspected his every move would be  carefully watched until the danger had passed.   He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he  couldn’t look after himself? He’d escaped Lord  Voldemort three times; he wasn’t completely useless Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of  Magnolia Crescent crossed his mind. What to do when  you know the worst is coming. . . .   “I’m not going to be murdered,” Harry said out loud.   “That’s the spirit, dear,” said his mirror sleepily  Tom woke Harry the next morning with his usual  toothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got dressed and  was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back  into her cage when Ron banged his way into the  room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking  irritable.   “The sooner we get on the train, the better,” he said.  “At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now  he’s accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of  Penelope Clearwater. You know,” Ron grimaced, “his  girlfriend. She’s hidden her face under the frame  because her nose has gone all blotchy. ...”   “I’ve got something to tell you,” Harry began, but they  were interrupted by Fred and George, who had looked  in to congratulate Ron on infuriating Percy again.   They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley  was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a  furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was tellin Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she’d made  as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly.   “What were you saying?” Ron asked Harry as they sat  down.   “Later,” Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.   Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in  the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all  their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron’s narrow  staircase and piling them up near the door, with  Hedwig and Hermes, Percy’s screech owl, perched on  top in their cages. A small wickerwork basket stood  beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.   “It’s all right, Crookshanks,” Hermione cooed through  the wickerwork. “I’ll let you out on the train.”   “You won’t,” snapped Ron. “What about poor  Scabbers, eh?”   He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated  that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.   Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the  Ministry cars, stuck his head inside.   “They’re here,” he said. “Harry, come on.”   Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch  of pavement toward the first of two old-fashioned dark  green cars, each of which was driven by a furtive-  looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.   “In you get, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and  down the crowded street Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly  joined by Hermione, Ron, and, to Ron’s disgust,   Percy.   The journey to King’s Cross was very uneventful  compared with Harry’s trip on the Knight Bus. The  Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost ordinary,  though Harry noticed that they could slide through  gaps that Uncle Vernon’s new company car certainly  couldn’t have managed. They reached King’s Cross  with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers  found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched  their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away,  somehow managing to jump to the head of an  unmoving line at the traffic lights.   Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry’s elbow all the way  into the station.   “Right then,” he said, glancing around them. “Let’s do  this in pairs, as there are so many of us. I’ll go  through first with Harry.”   Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between  platforms nine and ten, pushing Harry’s trolley and  apparently very interested in the Intercity 125 that  had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful  look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier.  Harry imitated him.   In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the  solid metal onto platform nine and three-quarters and  looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet  steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed  with witches and wizards seeing their children onto  the train Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry.  They were panting and had apparently taken the  barrier at a run.   “Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Percy, smoothing his hair  and going pink again. Ginny caught Harry’s eye, and  they both turned away to hide their laughter as Percy  strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking with  his chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his  shiny badge.   Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had  joined them, Harry and Ron led the way to the end of  the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage  that looked quite empty. They loaded the trunks onto  it, stowed Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage  rack, then went back outside to say good-bye to Mr.  and Mrs. Weasley.   Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione,  and finally, Harry. He was embarrassed, but really  quite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.   “Do take care, won’t you, Harry?” she said as she  straightened up, her eyes oddly bright. Then she  opened her enormous handbag and said, “I’ve made  you all sandwiches. ... Here you are, Ron ... no,  they’re not corned beef. ... Fred? Where’s Fred? Here  you are, dear. ...”   “Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a  moment.”   He jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed  him behind it, leaving the others crowded around  Mrs. Weasley.   “There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave  — ” said Mr. Weasley, in a tense voice “It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry. “I already  know.”   “You know? How could you know?”   “I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last  night. I couldn’t help hearing,” Harry added quickly.  “Sorry — ”   “That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find  out,” said Mr. Weasley, looking anxious.   “No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t  broken your word to Fudge and I know what’s going  on.”   “Harry, you must be very scared — ”   “I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. “Really” he added,  because Mr. Weasley was looking disbelieving. “I’m  not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius Black  can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?”   Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but  overlooked it.   “Harry, I knew you were, well, made of stronger stuff  than Fudge seems to think, and I’m obviously pleased  that you’re not scared, but — ”   “Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, who was now  shepherding the rest onto the train. “Arthur, what are  you doing? It’s about to go!”   “He’s coming, Molly!” said Mr. Weasley but he turned  back to Harry and kept talking in a lower and more  hurried voice. “Listen, I want you to give me your  word —  “ — that I’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle?” said  Harry gloomily.   “Not entirely,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked more  serious than Harry had ever seen him. “Harry, swear  to me you won’t go looking for Black.”   Harry stared. “What?”   There was a loud whistle. Guards were walking along  the train, slamming all the doors shut.   “Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, talking more  quickly still, “that whatever happens — ”   “Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to  kill me?” said Harry blankly.   “Swear to me that whatever you might hear — ”   “Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs. Weasley.   Steam was billowing from the train; it had started to  move. Harry ran to the compartment door and Ron  threw it open and stood back to let him on. They  leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs.  Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked  them from view.   “I need to talk to you in private,” Harry muttered to  Ron and Hermione as the train picked up speed.   “Go away, Ginny,” said Ron.   “Oh, that’s nice,” said Ginny huffily, and she stalked  off Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor,  looking for an empty compartment, but all were full  except for the one at the very end of the train.   This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep  next to the window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione  checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts Express was  usually reserved for students and they had never seen  an adult there before, except for the witch who  pushed the food cart.   The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of  wizard’s robes that had been darned in several places.  He looked ill and exhausted. Though quite young, his  light brown hair was flecked with gray.   “Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat  down and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest  away from the window.   “Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.  “How d’you know that?”   “It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage  rack over the man’s head, where there was a small,  battered case held together with a large quantity of  neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin  was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.   “Wonder what he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at  Professor Lupin’s pallid profile.   “That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only  one vacancy, isn’t there? Defense Against the Dark  Arts.”   Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two  Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, both o whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors  that the job was jinxed.   “Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He  looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn’t  he? Anyway ...” He turned to Harry. “What were you  going to tell us?”   Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s  argument and the warning Mr. Weasley had just  given him. When he’d finished, Ron looked  thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her  mouth. She finally lowered them to say, “Sirius Black  escaped to come after you? Oh, Harry ... you’ll have to  be really, really careful. Don’t go looking for trouble,  Harry — ”   “I don’t go looking for trouble,” said Harry, nettled.  “Trouble usually finds me.”   “How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a  nutter who wants to kill him?” said Ron shakily.   They were taking the news worse than Harry had  expected. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much  more frightened of Black than he was.   “No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,” said Ron  uncomfortably. “No one’s ever done it before. And he  was a top-security prisoner too.”   “But they’ll catch him, won’t they?” said Hermione  earnestly. “I mean, they’ve got all the Muggles looking  out for him too. ...”   “What’s that noise?” said Ron suddenly.   A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from  somewhere. They looked all around the compartment “It’s coming from your trunk, Harry,” said Ron,  standing up and reaching into the luggage rack. A  moment later he had pulled the Pocket Sneakoscope  out from between Harry’s robes. It was spinning very  fast in the palm of Ron’s hand and glowing brilliantly.   “Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly,  standing up for a better look.   “Yeah ... mind you, it’s a very cheap one,” Ron said.   “It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to  send it to Harry.”   “Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?”  said Hermione shrewdly.   “No! Well ... I wasn’t supposed to be using Errol. You  know he’s not really up to long journeys ... but how  else was I supposed to get Harry’s present to him?”   “Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the  Sneakoscope whistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake him  up.”   He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the  Sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle  Vernon’s old socks, which deadened the sound, then  closed the lid of the trunk on it.   “We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron,  sitting back down. “They sell that sort of thing in  Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff.  Fred and George told me.”   “Do you know much about Hogsmeade?” asked  Hermione keenly. “I’ve read it’s the only entirely non-  Muggle settlement in Britain —  “Yeah, I think it is,” said Ron in an offhand sort of  way, “but that’s not why I want to go. I just want to  get inside Honeydukes!”   “What’s that?” said Hermione.   “It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming  over his face, “where they’ve got everything. ... Pepper  Imps — they make you smoke at the mouth — and  great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and  clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which  you can suck in class and just look like you’re  thinking what to write next — ”   “But Hogsmeade’s a very interesting place, isn’t it?”  Hermione pressed on eagerly. “In Sites of Historical  Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the  1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack’s  supposed to be the most severely haunted building in  Britain — ”   “ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a  few inches off the ground while you’re sucking them,”  said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word  Hermione was saying.   Hermione looked around at Harry.   “Won’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and  explore Hogsmeade?”   “ ’Spect it will,” said Harry heavily. “You’ll have to tell  me when you’ve found out.”   “What d’you mean?” said Ron.   “I can’t go. The Dursleys didn’t sign my permission  form, and Fudge wouldn’t either. Ron looked horrified “You’re not allowed to come? But — no way —  McGonagall or someone will give you permission — ”   Harry gave a hollow laugh. Professor McGonagall,  head of Gryffindor House, was very strict.   “ — or we can ask Fred and George, they know every  secret passage out of the castle — ”   “Ron!” said Hermione sharply. “I don’t think Harry  should be sneaking out of school with Black on the  loose — ”   “Yeah, I expect that’s what McGonagall will say when  I ask for permission,” said Harry bitterly.   “But if we’re with him,” said Ron spiritedly to  Hermione, “Black wouldn’t dare — ”   “Oh, Ron, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped Hermione.  “Black’s already murdered a whole bunch of people in  the middle of a crowded street. Do you really think  he’s going to worry about attacking Harry just  because we’re there?”   She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks’s  basket as she spoke.   “Don’t let that thing out!” Ron said, but too late;  Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched,  yawned, and sprang onto Ron’s knees; the lump in  Ron’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks  angrily away.   “Get out of here!”   “Ron, don’t!” said Hermione angrily Ron was about to answer back when Professor Lupin  stirred. They watched him apprehensively, but he  simply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly  open, and slept on.   The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the  scenery outside the window became wilder and darker  while the clouds overhead thickened. People were  chasing backward and forward past the door of their  compartment. Crookshanks had now settled in an  empty seat, his squashed face turned toward Ron, his  yellow eyes on Ron’s top pocket.   At one o’clock, the plump witch with the food cart  arrived at the compartment door.   “D’you think we should wake him up?” Ron asked  awkwardly, nodding toward Professor Lupin. “He  looks like he could do with some food.”   Hermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously.   “Er — Professor?” she said. “Excuse me — Professor?”   He didn’t move.   “Don’t worry, dear,” said the witch as she handed  Harry a large stack of Cauldron Cakes. “If he’s hungry  when he wakes, I’ll be up front with the driver.”   “I suppose he is asleep?” said Ron quietly as the witch  slid the compartment door closed. “I mean — he  hasn’t died, has he?”   “No, no, he’s breathing,” whispered Hermione, taking  the Cauldron Cake Harry passed her.   He might not be very good company, but Professor  Lupin’s presence in their compartment had its uses Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring  the rolling hills outside the window, they heard  footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least  favorite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy,  flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory  Goyle.   Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since  they had met on their very first train journey to  Hogwarts. Malfoy, who had a pale, pointed, sneering  face, was in Slytherin House; he played Seeker on the  Slytherin Quidditch team, the same position that  Harry played on the Gryffindor team. Crabbe and  Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They  were both wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with  a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle  had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.   “Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy  drawl, pulling open the compartment door. “Potty and  the Weasel.”   Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.   “I heard your father finally got his hands on some  gold this summer, Weasley,” said Malfoy. “Did your  mother die of shock?”   Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks’s  basket to the floor. Professor Lupin gave a snort.   “Who’s that?” said Malfoy, taking an automatic step  backward as he spotted Lupin.   “New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in  case he needed to hold Ron back. “What were you  saying, Malfoy? Malfoy’s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn’t fool enough to  pick a fight right under a teacher’s nose.   “C’mon,” he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and  Goyle, and they disappeared.   Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his  knuckles.   “I’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,”  he said angrily. “I mean it. If he makes one more  crack about my family, I’m going to get hold of his  head and — ”   Ron made a violent gesture in midair.   “Ron,” hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin,  “be careful ...”   But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.   The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north;  the windows were now a solid, shimmering gray,  which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into  life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.  The train rattled, the rain hammered, the wind  roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept.   “We must be nearly there,” said Ron, leaning forward  to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely  black window.   The words had hardly left him when the train started  to slow down.   “Great,” said Ron, getting up and walking carefully  past Professor Lupin to try and see outside. “I’m  starving. I want to get to the feast. ... “We can’t be there yet,” said Hermione, checking her  watch.   “So why’re we stopping?”   The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise  of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded  louder than ever against the windows.   Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into  the corridor. All along the carriage, heads were  sticking curiously out of their compartments.   The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds  and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of  the racks. Then, without warning, all the lamps went  out and they were plunged into total darkness.   “What’s going on?” said Ron’s voice from behind  Harry.   “Ouch!” gasped Hermione. “Ron, that was my foot!”  Harry felt his way back to his seat.   “D’you think we’ve broken down?”   “Dunno ...”   There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim  black outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the  window and peering out.   “There’s something moving out there,” Ron said. “I  think people are coming aboard. ...”   The compartment door suddenly opened and someone  fell painfully over Harry’s legs “Sorry — d’you know what’s going on? — Ouch —  sorry — ”   “Hullo, Neville,” said Harry, feeling around in the dark  and pulling Neville up by his cloak.   “Harry? Is that you? What’s happening?”   “No idea — sit down — ”   There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville  had tried to sit on Crookshanks.   “I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on,”  came Hermione’s voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard  the door slide open again, and then a thud and two  loud squeals of pain.   “Who’s that?”   “Who’s that?”   “Ginny?”   “Hermione?”   “What are you doing?”   “I was looking for Ron — ”   “Come in and sit down — ”   “Not here!” said Harry hurriedly. “I’m here!”   “Ouch!” said Neville.   “Quiet!” said a hoarse voice suddenly Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last.  Harry could hear movements in his corner. None of  them spoke.   There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering  light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin  appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They  illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked  alert and wary.   “Stay where you are,” he said in the same hoarse  voice, and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of  fire held out in front of him.   But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could  reach it.   Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering  flames in Lupin’s hand, was a cloaked figure that  towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden  beneath its hood. Harry’s eyes darted downward, and  what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a  hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening,  grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something  dead that had decayed in water. . . .   But it was visible only for a split second. As though  the creature beneath the cloak sensed Harry’s gaze,  the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its  black cloak.   And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it  was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it  were trying to suck something more than air from its  surroundings.   An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his  own breath catch in his chest. The cold went deepe than his skin. It was inside his chest, it was inside  his very heart. .. Harry’s eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn’t see.  He was drowning in cold. There was a rushing in his  ears as though of water. He was being dragged  downward, the roaring growing louder . . .   And then, from far away, he heard screaming,  terrible, terrified, pleading screams. He wanted to  help whoever it was, he tried to move his arms, but  couldn’t ... a thick white fog was swirling around him,  inside him —   “Harry! Harry! Are you all right?”   Someone was slapping his face.   “W — what?”   Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above  him, and the floor was shaking — the Hogwarts  Express was moving again and the lights had come  back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto  the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to  him, and above them he could see Neville and  Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when  he put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he  felt cold sweat on his face.   Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.   “Are you okay?” Ron asked nervously.   “Yeah,” said Harry, looking quickly toward the door.  The hooded creature had vanished. “What happened?  Where’s that — that thing? Who screamed?”   “No one screamed,” said Ron, more nervously still Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny  and Neville looked back at him, both very pale.   “But I heard screaming — ”   A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was  breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.   “Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly  large piece. “Eat it. It’ll help.”   Harry took the chocolate but didn’t eat it.   “What was that thing?” he asked Lupin.   “A dementor,” said Lupin, who was now giving  chocolate to everyone else. “One of the dementors of  Azkaban.”   Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up  the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket.   “Eat,” he repeated. “It’ll help. I need to speak to the  driver, excuse me ...”   He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the  corridor.   “Are you sure you’re okay, Harry?” said Hermione,  watching Harry anxiously.   “I don’t get it. ... What happened?” said Harry, wiping  more sweat off his face.   “Well — that thing — the dementor — stood there and  looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn’t see its  face) — and you — you —  “I thought you were having a fit or something,” said  Ron, who still looked scared. “You went sort of rigid  and fell out of your seat and started twitching — ”   “And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked  toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,” said  Hermione, “and he said, ‘None of us is hiding Sirius  Black under our cloaks. Go.’ But the dementor didn’t  move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery  thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around  and sort of glided away. ...”   “It was horrible,” said Neville, in a higher voice than  usual. “Did you feel how cold it got when it came in?”   “I felt weird,” said Ron, shifting his shoulders  uncomfortably. “Like I’d never be cheerful again. ...”   Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly  as bad as Harry felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went  over and put a comforting arm around her.   “But didn’t any of you — fall off your seats?” said  Harry awkwardly.   “No,” said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again.  “Ginny was shaking like mad, though. ...”   Harry didn’t understand. He felt weak and shivery, as  though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he  also felt the beginnings of shame. Why had he gone to  pieces like that, when no one else had?   Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he  entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile,  “I haven’t poisoned that chocolate, you know. ... Harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt  warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and  toes.   “Well be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,” said Professor  Lupin. “Are you all right, Harry?”   Harry didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.   “Fine,” he muttered, embarrassed.   They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the  journey. At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade  station, and there was a great scramble to get  outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville’s pet  toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was  freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down  in icy sheets.   “Firs’ years this way!” called a familiar voice. Harry,  Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic  outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform,  beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward  for their traditional journey across the lake.   “All righ’, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of  the crowd. They waved at him, but had no chance to  speak to him because the mass of people around  them was shunting them away along the platform.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the  school along the platform and out onto a rough mud  track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited  the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only  assume, by an invisible horse, because when they  climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all  by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.   The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry  felt better since the chocolate, but still weak. Ron an Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though  frightened he might collapse again.   As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent  wrought iron gates, flanked with stone columns  topped with winged boars, Harry saw two more  towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on  either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to  engulf him again; he leaned back into the lumpy seat  and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates.  The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping  drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of  the tiny window, watching the many turrets and  towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a  halt, and Hermione and Ron got out.   As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice  sounded in his ear.   “You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom telling the truth?  You actually fainted?”   Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry’s way  up the stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and  his pale eyes glinting maliciously.   “Shove off, Malfoy,” said Ron, whose jaw was  clenched.   “Did you faint as well, Weasley?” said Malfoy loudly.  “Did the scary old dementor frighten you too,  Weasley?”   “Is there a problem?” said a mild voice. Professor  Lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage.   Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which  took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated  suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, h said, “Oh, no — er — Professor,” then he smirked at  Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the  castle.   Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him  hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd  swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front  doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit  with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent  marble staircase that led to the upper floors.   The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right;  Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely  glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and  cloudy tonight, when a voice called, “Potter! Granger!   I want to see you both!”   Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised.  Professor McGonagall, Transfiguration teacher and  head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the heads  of the crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore  her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed  with square spectacles. Harry fought his way over to  her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall  had a way of making him feel he must have done  something wrong.   “There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a  word in my office,” she told them. “Move along there,  Weasley.”   Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered  Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd;  they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up  the marble staircase, and along a corridor.   Once they were in her office, a small room with a  large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned  Harry and Hermione to sit down. She settled hersel behind her desk and said abruptly, “Professor Lupin  sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on  the train, Potter.”   Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on  the door and Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, came  bustling in.   Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad  enough that he’d passed out, or whatever he had  done, without everyone making all this fuss.   “I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything — ”   “Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring  this and bending down to stare closely at him. “I  suppose you’ve been doing something dangerous  again?”   “It was a dementor, Poppy,” said Professor  McGonagall.   They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey  clucked disapprovingly.   “Setting dementors around a school,” she muttered,  pushing back Harry’s hair and feeling his forehead.  “He won’t be the last one who collapses. Yes, he’s all  clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they  have on people who are already delicate — ”   “I’m not delicate!” said Harry crossly.   “Of course you’re not,” said Madam Pomfrey  absentmindedly, now taking his pulse.   “What does he need?” said Professor McGonagall  crisply. “Bed rest? Should he perhaps spend tonight  in the hospital wing? ‘Tm /ine!” said Harry, jumping up. The thought of  what Draco Malfoy would say if he had to go to the  hospital wing was torture.   “Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very  least,” said Madam Pomfrey, who was now trying to  peer into Harry’s eyes.   “I’ve already had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin  gave me some. He gave it to all of us.”   “Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So  we’ve finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts  teacher who knows his remedies?”   “Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?” Professor  McGonagall said sharply.   “Yes,” said Harry.   “Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick  word with Miss Granger about her course schedule,  then we can go down to the feast together.”   Harry went back into the corridor with Madam  Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to  herself. He had to wait only a few minutes; then  Hermione emerged looking very happy about  something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the  three of them made their way back down the marble  staircase to the Great Hall.   It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long  House tables was lined with students, their faces  glimmering by the light of thousands of candles,  which were floating over the tables in midair.   Professor Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a  shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and  a three-legged stool out of the hall “Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the  Sorting!”   New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by  trying on the Sorting Hat, which shouted out the  House they were best suited to (Gryffindor,   Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor  McGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the  staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the  other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the  Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as  they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of  them pointed at Harry. Had the story of his collapsing  in front of the dementor traveled that fast?   He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who  had saved them seats.   “What was all that about?” he muttered to Harry.   Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that  moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and he  broke off.   Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave  an impression of great energy. He had several feet of  long silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles, and  an extremely crooked nose. He was often described as  the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn’t why  Harry respected him. You couldn’t help trusting Albus  Dumbledore, and as Harry watched him beaming  around at the students, he felt really calm for the first  time since the dementor had entered the train  compartment.   “Welcome!” said Dumbledore, the candlelight  shimmering on his beard. “Welcome to another year  at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and  as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get i out of the way before you become befuddled by our  excellent feast. ...”   Dumbledore cleared his throat and continued, “As  you will all be aware after their search of the  Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing  host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are  here on Ministry of Magic business.”   He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley  had said about Dumbledore not being happy with the  dementors guarding the school.   “They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,”  Dumbledore continued, “and while they are with us, I  must make it plain that nobody is to leave school  without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled  by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks,”  he added blandly, and Harry and Ron glanced at each  other. “It is not in the nature of a dementor to  understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn  each and every one of you to give them no reason to  harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head  Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul  of the dementors,” he said.   Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry,  puffed out his chest again and stared around  impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked  very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or  made a sound.   “On a happier note,” he continued, “I am pleased to  welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year.   “First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to  fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic  applause. Only those who had been in the  compartment on the train with Professor Lupin  clapped hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin  looked particularly shabby next to all the other  teachers in their best robes.   “Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.   Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring  along the staff table at Professor Lupin. It was  common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense  Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated  Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his  thin, sallow face. It was beyond anger: it was loathing.  Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the  look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.   “As to our second new appointment,” Dumbledore  continued as the lukewarm applause for Professor  Lupin died away. “Well, I am sorry to tell you that  Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures  teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to  enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I  am delighted to say that his place will be filled by  none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to  take on this teaching job in addition to his  gamekeeping duties.”   Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another,  stunned. Then they joined in with the applause,  which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor table in  particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who  was ruby-red in the face and staring down at his  enormous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of  his black beard “We should’ve known!” Ron roared, pounding the  table. “Who else would have assigned us a biting  book? Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop  clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started  speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his  eyes on the tablecloth.   “Well, I think that’s everything of importance,” said  Dumbledore. “Let the feast begin!”   The golden plates and goblets before them filled  suddenly with food and drink. Harry, suddenly  ravenous, helped himself to everything he could reach  and began to eat.   It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk,  laughter, and the clatter of knives and forks. Harry,  Ron, and Hermione, however, were eager for it to  finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew  how much being made a teacher would mean to him.  Hagrid wasn’t a fully qualified wizard; he had been  expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for a crime  he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and  Hermione who had cleared Hagrid ’s name last year.   At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart  had melted from the golden platters, Dumbledore  gave the word that it was time for them all to go to  bed, and they got their chance.   “Congratulations, Hagrid!” Hermione squealed as they  reached the teachers’ table.   “All down ter you three,” said Hagrid, wiping his  shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them.  “Can’ believe it ... great man, Dumbledore ... came  straight down to me hut after Professor Kettlebur said he’d had enough. ... It’s what I always wanted Overcome with emotion, he buried his face in his  napkin, and Professor McGonagall shooed them away.   Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors  streaming up the marble staircase and, very tired  now, along more corridors, up more and more stairs,  to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower. A large  portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them,  “Password?”   “Coming through, coming through!” Percy called from  behind the crowd. “The new password’s ‘Fortuna  Major’!”   “Oh no,” said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always  had trouble remembering the passwords.   Through the portrait hole and across the common  room, the girls and boys divided toward their separate  staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair with no  thought in his head except how glad he was to be  back. They reached their familiar, circular dormitory  with its five four-poster beds, and Harry, looking  around, felt he was home at last When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great  Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they  saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining  a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As  they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a  swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter.   “Ignore him,” said Hermione, who was right behind  Harry. “Just ignore him, it’s not worth it. ...”   “Hey, Potter!” shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin  girl with a face like a pug. “Potter! The dementors are  coming, Potter! Woooooooo!”   Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next  to George Weasley.   “New third-year course schedules,” said George,  passing them over. “What’s up with you, Harry?”   “Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting down on George’s other  side and glaring over at the Slytherin table George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to  faint with terror again.   “That little git,” he said calmly. “He wasn’t so cocky  last night when the dementors were down at our end  of the train. Came running into our compartment,  didn’t he, Fred?”   “Nearly wet himself,” said Fred, with a contemptuous  glance at Malfoy.   “I wasn’t too happy myself,” said George. “They’re  horrible things, those dementors. ...”   “Sort of freeze your insides, don’t they?” said Fred.   “You didn’t pass out, though, did you?” said Harry in  a low voice.   “Forget it, Harry,” said George bracingly. “Dad had to  go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he  said it was the worst place he’d ever been, he came  back all weak and shaking. . . . They suck the  happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the  prisoners go mad in there.”   “Anyway, we’ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our  first Quidditch match,” said Fred. “Gryffindor versus  Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?”   The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other  in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off  worse. Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped  himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.   Hermione was examining her new schedule.   “Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,”  she said happily “Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he looked over her  shoulder, “they’ve messed up your schedule. Look —  they’ve got you down for about ten subjects a day.  There isn’t enough time.”   “I’ll manage. I’ve fixed it all with Professor  McGonagall.”   “But look,” said Ron, laughing, “see this morning?  Nine o’clock, Divination. And underneath, nine  o’clock, Muggle Studies. And” — Ron leaned closer to  the schedule, disbelieving — “ look — underneath  that, Arithmancy, nine o’clock. I mean, I know you’re  good, Hermione, but no one’s that good. How’re you  supposed to be in three classes at once?”   “Don’t be silly,” said Hermione shortly. “Of course I  won’t be in three classes at once.”   “Well, then — ”   “Pass the marmalade,” said Hermione.   “But — ”   “Oh, Ron, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?”  Hermione snapped. “I told you, I’ve fixed it all with  Professor McGonagall.”   Just then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. He was  wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was  absentmindedly swinging a dead polecat from one  enormous hand.   “All righ’?” he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the  staff table. “Yer in my firs’ ever lesson! Right after  lunch! Bin up since five gettin’ everythin’ ready. ...  Hope it’s okay. ... Me, a teacher ... hones’ly. ... He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the  staff table, still swinging the polecat.   “Wonder what he’s been getting ready?” said Ron, a  note of anxiety in his voice.   The hall was starting to empty as people headed off  toward their first lesson. Ron checked his course  schedule.   “We’d better go, look, Divination’s at the top of North  Tower. It’ll take us ten minutes to get there. ...”   They finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye  to Fred and George, and walked back through the  hall. As they passed the Slytherin table, Malfoy did  yet another impression of a fainting fit. The shouts of  laughter followed Harry into the entrance hall.   The journey through the castle to North Tower was a  long one. Two years at Hogwarts hadn’t taught them  everything about the castle, and they had never been  inside North Tower before.   “There’s — got — to — be — a — shortcut,” Ron  panted as they climbed their seventh long staircase  and emerged on an unfamiliar landing, where there  was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of  grass hanging on the stone wall.   “I think it’s this way,” said Hermione, peering down  the empty passage to the right.   “Can’t be,” said Ron. “That’s south, look, you can see  a bit of the lake out of the window ...”   Harry was watching the painting. A fat, dapple-gray  pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing  nonchalantly. Harry was used to the subjects o Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their  frames to visit one another, but he always enjoyed  watching it. A moment later, a short, squat knight in  a suit of armor clanked into the picture after his  pony. By the look of the grass stains on his metal  knees, he had just fallen off.   “Aha!” he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  “What villains are these, that trespass upon my  private lands! Come to scorn at my fall, perchance?  Draw, you knaves, you dogs!”   They watched in astonishment as the little knight  tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began  brandishing it violently, hopping up and down in  rage. But the sword was too long for him; a  particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he  landed facedown in the grass.   “Are you all right?” said Harry, moving closer to the  picture.   “Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!”   The knight seized his sword again and used it to push  himself back up, but the blade sank deeply into the  grass and, though he pulled with all his might, he  couldn’t get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back  down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his  sweating face.   “Listen,” said Harry, taking advantage of the knight’s  exhaustion, “we’re looking for the North Tower. You  don’t know the way, do you?”   “A quest!” The knight’s rage seemed to vanish  instantly. He clanked to his feet and shouted, “Come  follow me, dear friends, and we shall find our goal, or  else shall perish bravely in the charge! He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and  failed to mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, “On  foot then, good sirs and gentle lady! On! On!”   And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the  frame and out of sight.   They hurried after him along the corridor, following  the sound of his armor. Every now and then they  spotted him running through a picture ahead.   “Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the  knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an  alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture  hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.   Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the  tightly spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier,  until at last they heard the murmur of voices above  them and knew they had reached the classroom.   “Farewell!” cried the knight, popping his head into a  painting of some sinister-looking monks. “Farewell,  my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble  heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!”   “Yeah, well call you,” muttered Ron as the knight  disappeared, “if we ever need someone mental.”   They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a  tiny landing, where most of the class was already  assembled. There were no doors off this landing, but  Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where  there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on  it.   “ ‘Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,’ ” Harry read.  “How’re we supposed to get up there? As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor  suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended  right at Harry’s feet. Everyone got quiet.   “After you,” said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the  ladder first.   He emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he  had ever seen. In fact, it didn’t look like a classroom  at all, more like a cross between someone’s attic and  an old-fashioned tea shop. At least twenty small,  circular tables were crammed inside it, all  surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs.  Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the  curtains at the windows were all closed, and the  many lamps were draped with dark red scarves. It  was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning  under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a  heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large  copper kettle. The shelves running around the  circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking  feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered  playing cards, countless silvery crystal balls, and a  huge array of teacups.   Ron appeared at Harry’s shoulder as the class  assembled around them, all talking in whispers.   “Where is she?” Ron said.   A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft,  misty sort of voice.   “Welcome,” it said. “How nice to see you in the  physical world at last.”   Harry’s immediate impression was of a large,  glittering insect. Professor Trelawney moved into the  firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; he large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their  natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled  shawl. Innumerable chains and beads hung around  her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were  encrusted with bangles and rings.   “Sit, my children, sit,” she said, and they all climbed  awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry,  Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same  round table.   “Welcome to Divination,” said Professor Trelawney,  who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front  of the fire. “My name is Professor Trelawney. You may  not have seen me before. I find that descending too  often into the hustle and bustle of the main school  clouds my Inner Eye.”   Nobody said anything to this extraordinary  pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately  rearranged her shawl and continued, “So you have  chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all  magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if  you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be  able to teach you. Books can take you only so far in  this field. ...”   At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced,  grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the  news that books wouldn’t be much help in this  subject.   “Many witches and wizards, talented though they are  in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden  disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled  mysteries of the future,” Professor Trelawney went on,  her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to  nervous face. “It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy, she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off  his pouf. “Is your grandmother well? “I think so,” said Neville tremulously.   “I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you, dear,” said  Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long  emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney  continued placidly. “We will be covering the basic  methods of Divination this year. The first term will be  devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall  progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,” she shot  suddenly at Parvati Patil, “beware a red-haired man.”   Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right  behind her, and edged her chair away from him.   “In the second term,” Professor Trelawney went on,   “we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have  finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately,  classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout  of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter,  one of our number will leave us forever.”   A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but  Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it.   “I wonder, dear,” she said to Lavender Brown, who  was nearest and shrank back in her chair, “if you  could pass me the largest silver teapot?”   Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an  enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on  the table in front of Professor Trelawney.   “Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are  dreading — it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of  October. Lavender trembled “Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a  teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it.  Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs  remain. Swill these around the cup three times with  the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its  saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then  give your cup to your partner to read. You will  interpret the patterns using pages five and six of  Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping  and instructing. Oh, and dear” — she caught Neville  by the arm as he made to stand up — “after you’ve  broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to  select one of the blue patterned ones? I’m rather  attached to the pink.”   Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf  of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china.  Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a  dustpan and brush and said, “One of the blue ones,  then, dear, if you wouldn’t mind ... thank you. ...”   When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled,  they went back to their table and tried to drink the  scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as  Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the  cups and swapped over.   “Right,” said Ron as they both opened their books at  pages five and six. “What can you see in mine?”   “A load of soggy brown stuff,” said Harry. The heavily  perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel  sleepy and stupid.   “Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes  to see past the mundane!” Professor Trelawney cried  through the gloom Harry tried to pull himself together.   “Right, you’ve got a crooked sort of cross ...” He  consulted Unfogging the Future. “That means you’re  going to have ‘trials and suffering’ — sorry about that  — but there’s a thing that could be the sun ... hang  on ... that means ‘great happiness’ ... so you’re going  to suffer but be very happy. ...”   “You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,” said  Ron, and they both had to stifle their laughs as  Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction.   “My turn ...” Ron peered into Harry’s teacup, his  forehead wrinkled with effort. “There’s a blob a bit like  a bowler hat,” he said. “Maybe you’re going to work  for the Ministry of Magic. ...”   He turned the teacup the other way up.   “But this way it looks more like an acorn. ... What’s  that?” He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future. “  ‘A windfall, unexpected gold.’ Excellent, you can lend  me some ... and there’s a thing here,” he turned the  cup again, “that looks like an animal . . . yeah, if that  was its head ... it looks like a hippo ... no, a sheep ...”   Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a  snort of laughter.   “Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to  Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry’s cup from  him. Everyone went quiet to watch.   Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup,  rotating it counterclockwise.   “The falcon ... my dear, you have a deadly enemy. “But everyone knows that,” said Hermione in a loud  whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her.   “Well, they do,” said Hermione. “Everybody knows  about Harry and You-Know-Who.”   Harry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of  amazement and admiration. They had never heard  Hermione speak to a teacher like that before.   Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered  her huge eyes to Harry’s cup again and continued to  turn it.   “The club ... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy  cup. ...”   “I thought that was a bowler hat,” said Ron  sheepishly.   “The skull ... danger in your path, my dear. ...”   Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor  Trelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and  then screamed.   There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville  had smashed his second cup. Professor Trelawney  sank into a vacant armchair, her glittering hand at  her heart and her eyes closed.   “My dear boy . . . my poor, dear boy ... no ... it is  kinder not to say ... no ... don’t ask me. ...”   “What is it, Professor?” said Dean Thomas at once.  Everyone had got to their feet, and slowly they  crowded around Harry and Ron’s table, pressing close  to Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at  Harry’s cup “My dear,” Professor Trelawney’s huge eyes opened  dramatically, “you have the Grim. “The what?” said Harry.   He could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t  understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and  Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody  else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.   “The Grim, my dear, the Grim!” cried Professor  Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry hadn’t  understood. “The giant, spectral dog that haunts  churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen — the worst  omen — of death .!”   Harry’s stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of  Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts — the dog in the  shadows of Magnolia Crescent . . . Lavender Brown  clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was  looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had  gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor  Trelawney’s chair.   “I don’t think it looks like a Grim,” she said flatly.   Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with  mounting dislike.   “You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I  perceive very little aura around you. Very little  receptivity to the resonances of the future.”   Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to  side.   “It looks like a Grim if you do this,” he said, with his  eyes almost shut, “but it looks more like a donkey  from here,” he said, leaning to the left “When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going  to die or not!” said Harry, taking even himself by  surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at him.   “I think we will leave the lesson here for today,” said  Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice. “Yes ...  please pack away your things. ...”   Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor  Trelawney, packed away their books, and closed their  bags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry’s eyes.   “Until we meet again,” said Professor Trelawney  faintly, “fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear” — she  pointed at Neville — “you’ll be late next time, so mind  you work extra-hard to catch up.”   Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor  Trelawney’s ladder and the winding stair in silence,  then set off for Professor McGonagall’s  Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find  her classroom that, early as they had left Divination,  they were only just in time.   Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room,  feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright  spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive  glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead  at any moment. He hardly heard what Professor  McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards  who could transform at will into animals), and wasn’t  even watching when she transformed herself in front  of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings  around her eyes.   “Really, what has got into you all today?” said  Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself with  a faint pop, and staring around at them all. “Not tha it matters, but that’s the first time my  transformation’s not got applause from a class. Everybody’s heads turned toward Harry again, but  nobody spoke. Then Hermione raised her hand.   “Please, Professor, we’ve just had our first Divination  class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and — ”   “Ah, of course,” said Professor McGonagall, suddenly  frowning. “There is no need to say any more, Miss  Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this  year?”   Everyone stared at her.   “Me,” said Harry, finally.   “I see,” said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with  her beady eyes. “Then you should know, Potter, that  Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one  student a year since she arrived at this school. None  of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her  favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for  the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues — ”   Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her  nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly,  “Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of  magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very  little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and  Professor Trelawney — ”   She stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-  fact tone, “You look in excellent health to me, Potter,  so you will excuse me if I don’t let you off homework  today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand  it in. Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was  harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away  from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of  Professor Trelawney’s classroom. Not everyone was  convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and  Lavender whispered, “But what about Neville’s cup?”   When the Transfiguration class had finished, they  joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for  lunch.   “Ron, cheer up,” said Hermione, pushing a dish of  stew toward him. “You heard what Professor  McGonagall said.”   Ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his  fork but didn’t start.   “Harry,” he said, in a low, serious voice, “you haven’t  seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?”   “Yeah, I have,” said Harry. “I saw one the night I left  the Dursleys’.”   Ron let his fork fall with a clatter.   “Probably a stray,” said Hermione calmly.   Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone  mad.   “Hermione, if Harry’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s  bad,” he said. “My — my uncle Bilius saw one and —  and he died twenty-four hours later!”   “Coincidence,” said Hermione airily, pouring herself  some pumpkin juice “You don’t know what you’re talking about!” said Ron,  starting to get angry. “Grims scare the living daylights  out of most wizards!”   “There you are, then,” said Hermione in a superior  tone. “They see the Grim and die of fright. The Grim’s  not an omen, it’s the cause of death! And Harry’s still  with us because he’s not stupid enough to see one  and think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!”   Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened  her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and  propped it open against the juice jug.   “I think Divination seems very woolly,” she said,  searching for her page. “A lot of guesswork, if you ask  me.”   “There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that  cup!” said Ron hotly.   “You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were  telling Harry it was a sheep,” said Hermione coolly.   “Professor Trelawney said you didn’t have the right  aura! You just don’t like being bad at something for a  change!”   He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her  Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits  of meat and carrot flew everywhere.   “If being good at Divination means I have to pretend  to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I’m not  sure I’ll be studying it much longer! That lesson was  absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy  class! She snatched up her bag and stalked away Ron frowned after her “What’s she talking about?” he said to Harry. “She  hasn’t been to an Arithmancy class yet.”   Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch.  Yesterday’s rain had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale  gray, and the grass was springy and damp underfoot  as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical  Creatures class.   Ron and Hermione weren’t speaking to each other.  Harry walked beside them in silence as they went  down the sloping lawns to Hagrid’s hut on the edge of  the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted  three only-too-familiar backs ahead of them that he  realized they must be having these lessons with the  Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe  and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure  he knew what they were talking about.   Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut.  He stood in his moleskin overcoat, with Fang the  boarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start.   “C’mon, now, get a move on!” he called as the class  approached. “Got a real treat for yeh today! Great  lesson cornin’ up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!”   For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid  was going to lead them into the forest; Harry had had  enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a  lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge  of the trees, and five minutes later, they found  themselves outside a kind of paddock. There was  nothing in there “Everyone gather ’round the fence here!” he called.  “That’s it — make sure yeh can see — now, firs’ thing  yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books — ”   “How?” said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.   “Eh?” said Hagrid.   “How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated. He  took out his copy of The Monster Book of Monsters,  which he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other  people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had  belted their book shut; others had crammed them  inside tight bags or clamped them together with  binder clips.   “Hasn’ — hasn’ anyone bin able ter open their  books?” said Hagrid, looking crestfallen.   The class all shook their heads.   “Yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em,” said Hagrid, as though  this was the most obvious thing in the world. “Look  He took Hermione’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape  that bound it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a  giant forefinger down its spine, and the book  shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.   “Oh, how silly we’ve all been!” Malfoy sneered. “We  should have stroked them! Why didn’t we guess!”   “I — I thought they were funny,” Hagrid said  uncertainly to Hermione.   “Oh, tremendously funny!” said Malfoy. “Really witty,  giving us books that try and rip our hands off! “Shut up, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Hagrid was  looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid ’s first  lesson to be a success.   “Righ’ then,” said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his  thread, “so — so yeh’ve got yer books an’ — an’ —  now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I’ll go  an’ get ’em. Hang on ...”   He strode away from them into the forest and out of  sight.   “God, this place is going to the dogs,” said Malfoy  loudly. “That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a  fit when I tell him — ”   “Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry repeated.   “Careful, Potter, there’s a dementor behind you — ”   “Oooooooh!” squealed Lavender Brown, pointing  toward the opposite side of the paddock.   Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre  creatures Harry had ever seen. They had the bodies,  hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs,  wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles,  with cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly  orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a  foot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a  thick leather collar around its neck, which was  attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these  were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came  jogging into the paddock behind the creatures.   “Gee up, there!” he roared, shaking the chains and  urging the creatures toward the fence where the class  stood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached  them and tethered the creatures to the fence “Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at  them. “Beau’iful, aren’ they?”   Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you  got over the first shock of seeing something that was  half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the  hippogriffs’ gleaming coats, changing smoothly from  feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy  gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and  inky black.   “So,” said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and  beaming around, “if yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer — ”   No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione,  however, approached the fence cautiously.   “Now, firs’ thing yeh gotta know abou’ hippogriffs is,  they’re proud,” said Hagrid. “Easily offended,  hippogriffs are. Don’t never insult one, ’cause it might  be the last thing yeh do.”   Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren’t listening; they  were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty  feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the  lesson.   “Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs’  move,” Hagrid continued. “It’s polite, see? Yeh walk  toward him, and yeh bow, an’ yeh wait. If he bows  back, yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn’ bow,  then get away from him sharpish, ’cause those talons  hurt.   “Right — who wants ter go first?”   Most of the class backed farther away in answer.   Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The  hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexin their powerful wings; they didn’t seem to like being  tethered like this.   “No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look.   “I’ll do it,” said Harry.   There was an intake of breath from behind him, and  both Lavender and Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no,  Harry, remember your tea leaves!”   Harry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock  fence.   “Good man, Harry!” roared Hagrid. “Right then — let’s  see how yeh get on with Buckbeak.”   He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff  away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather  collar. The class on the other side of the paddock  seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy’s eyes were  narrowed maliciously.   “Easy, now, Harry,” said Hagrid quietly. “Yeh’ve got  eye contact, now try not ter blink. ... Hippogriffs don’  trust yeh if yeh blink too much. ...”   Harry’s eyes immediately began to water, but he  didn’t shut them. Buckbeak had turned his great,  sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce  orange eye.   “Tha’s it,” said Hagrid. “Tha’s it, Harry ... now, bo Harry didn’t feel much like exposing the back of his  neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave  a short bow and then looked up The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It  didn’t move.   “Ah,” said Hagrid, sounding worried. “Right — back  away, now, Harry, easy does it — ”   But then, to Harry’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff  suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into  what was an unmistakable bow.   “Well done, Harry!” said Hagrid, ecstatic. “Right —  yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!”   Feeling that a better reward would have been to back  away, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and  reached out toward it. He patted the beak several  times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as  though enjoying it.   The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy,  Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply  disappointed.   “Righ’ then, Harry,” said Hagrid. “I reckon he might’  let yeh ride him!”   This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was  used to a broomstick; but he wasn’t sure a hippogriff  would be quite the same.   “Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said  Hagrid, “an’ mind yeh don’ pull any of his feathers  out, he won’ like that. ...”   Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak’s wing and  hoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up.  Harry wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything in  front of him was covered with feathers “Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s  hindquarters.   Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on  either side of Harry; he just had time to seize the  hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring  upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry  knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff’s wings  beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching  him under his legs and making him feel he was about  to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his  fingers and he didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead  of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he  now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the  hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its  wings.   Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and  then headed back to the ground; this was the bit  Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the  smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off  over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-  assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold  on and push himself straight again.   “Good work, Harry!” roared Hagrid as everyone except  Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. “Okay, who else  wants a go?”   Emboldened by Harry’s success, the rest of the class  climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied  the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were  bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran  repeatedly backward from his, which didn’t seem to  want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced  on the chestnut, while Harry watched Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak.  He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his  beak, looking disdainful.   “This is very easy,” Malfoy drawled, loud enough for  Harry to hear him. “I knew it must have been, if  Potter could do it. ... I bet you’re not dangerous at all,  are you?” he said to the hippogriff. “Are you, you great  ugly brute?”   It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a  high-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was  wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he  strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,  blood blossoming over his robes.   “I’m dying!” Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. “I’m  dying, look at me! It’s killed me!”   “Yer not dyin’!” said Hagrid, who had gone very white.  “Someone help me — gotta get him outta here — ”   Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted  Malfoy easily. As they passed, Harry saw that there  was a long, deep gash on Malfoy’s arm; blood  splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the  slope toward the castle.   Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class  followed at a walk. The Slytherins were all shouting  about Hagrid.   “They should fire him straight away!” said Pansy  Parkinson, who was in tears.   “It was Malfoy’s fault!” snapped Dean Thomas.   Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted  entrance hall.   “I’m going to see if he’s okay!” said Pansy, and they all  watched her run up the marble staircase. The  Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away  in the direction of their dungeon common room;   Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to  Gryffindor Tower.   “D’you think he’ll be all right?” said Hermione  nervously.   “ ’Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in  about a second,” said Harry, who had had far worse  injuries mended magically by the nurse.   “That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid ’s  first class, though, wasn’t it?” said Ron, looking  worried. “Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him. ...”   They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at  dinnertime, hoping to see Hagrid, but he wasn’t there.   “They wouldn’t fire him, would they?” said Hermione  anxiously, not touching her steak-and-kidney  pudding.   “They’d better not,” said Ron, who wasn’t eating  either.   Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group  including Crabbe and Goyle was huddled together,  deep in conversation. Harry was sure they were  cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been  injured.   “Well, you can’t say it wasn’t an interesting first day  back,” said Ron gloomily They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common  room after dinner and tried to do the homework  Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of  them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower  window.   “There’s a light on in Hagrid’s window,” Harry said  suddenly.   Ron looked at his watch.   “If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It’s still  quite early. ...”   “I don’t know,” Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw  her glance at him.   “I’m allowed to walk across the grounds,” he said  pointedly. “Sirius Black hasn’t got past the dementors  yet, has he?”   So they put their things away and headed out of the  portrait hole, glad to meet nobody on their way to the  front doors, as they weren’t entirely sure they were  supposed to be out.   The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the  twilight. When they reached Hagrid’s hut, they  knocked, and a voice growled, “C’min.”   Hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed  wooden table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in  Hagrid’s lap. One look told them that Hagrid had been  drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as  big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be  having difficulty getting them into focus “ ’Spect it’s a record,” he said thickly, when he  recognized them. “Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a  teacher who lasted on’y a day before.”   “You haven’t been fired, Hagrid!” gasped Hermione.   “Not yet,” said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp  of whatever was in the tankard. “But ’s only a matter  o’ time, i’n’t it, after Malfoy ...”   “How is he?” said Ron as they all sat down. “It wasn’t  serious, was it?”   “Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said  Hagrid dully, “but he’s sayin’ it’s still agony ... covered  in bandages ... moanin’ ...”   “He’s faking it,” said Harry at once. “Madam Pomfrey  can mend anything. She regrew half my bones last  year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it’s worth.”   “School gov’nors have bin told, o’ course,” said Hagrid  miserably. “They reckon I started too big. Shoulda left  hippogriffs fer later ... done flobberworms or summat.  ... Jus’ thought it’d make a good firs’ lesson. ... ’S all  my fault. ...”   “It’s all Malfoy ’s fault, Hagrid!” said Hermione  earnestly.   “We’re witnesses,” said Harry. “You said hippogriffs  attack if you insult them. It’s Malfoy’s problem that  he wasn’t listening. We’ll tell Dumbledore what really  happened.”   “Yeah, don’t worry, Hagrid, we’ll back you up,” said  Ron Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid ’s  beetle-black eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron  and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.   “I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,” said  Hermione firmly. She took the tankard from the table  and went outside to empty it.   “Ar, maybe she’s right,” said Hagrid, letting go of  Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing  their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and  followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a  loud splash.   “What’s he done?” said Harry nervously as Hermione  came back in with the empty tankard.   “Stuck his head in the water barrel,” said Hermione,  putting the tankard away.   Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping  wet, wiping the water out of his eyes.   “Tha’s better,” he said, shaking his head like a dog  and drenching them all. “Listen, it was good of yeh ter  come an’ see me, I really — ”   Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he’d  only just realized he was there.   “WHAT DYEH THINK YOU’RE DOIN’, EH?” he roared,  so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air.   “YEH ’RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN’ AROUND AFTER  DARK, HARRY! AN’ YOU TWO! LETTIN’ HIM!”   Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and  pulled him to the door “C’mon!” Hagrid said angrily. “I’m takin’yer all back  up ter school, an’ don’ let me catch yeh walkin’ down  ter see me after dark again. I’m not worth that!  Malfoy didn’t reappear in classes until late on  Thursday morning, when the Slytherins and  Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He  swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in  bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry’s  opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of  some dreadful battle.   “How is it, Draco?” simpered Pansy Parkinson. “Does  it hurt much?”   “Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of  grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and  Goyle when Pansy had looked away.   “Settle down, settle down,” said Professor Snape idly.   Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn’t  have said “settle down” if they’d walked in late, he’d  have given them detention. But Malfoy had always  been able to get away with anything in Snape ’ classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and  generally favored his own students above all others They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking  Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to  Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their  ingredients on the same table.   “Sir,” Malfoy called, “sir, I’ll need help cutting up  these daisy roots, because of my arm — ”   “Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him,” said Snape  without looking up.   Ron went brick red.   “There’s nothing wrong with your arm,” he hissed at  Malfoy.   Malfoy smirked across the table.   “Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these  roots.”   Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy’s roots toward  him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they  were all different sizes.   “Professor,” drawled Malfoy, “Weasley’s mutilating my  roots, sir.”   Snape approached their table, stared down his  hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an  unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black  hair.   “Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.”   “But, sir — ! Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully  shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.   “Now,” said Snape in his most dangerous voice.   Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the  table at Malfoy, then took up the knife again.   “And, sir, 111 need this shrivelfig skinned,” said  Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.   “Potter, you can skin Malfoy’s shrivelfig,” said Snape,  giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved  just for him.   Harry took Malfoy’s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to  repair the damage to the roots he now had to use.  Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and  flung it back across the table at Malfoy without  speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than  ever.   “Seen your pal Hagrid lately?” he asked them quietly.   “None of your business,” said Ron jerkily, without  looking up.   “I’m afraid he won’t be a teacher much longer,” said  Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow. “Father’s not very  happy about my injury — ”   “Keep talking, Malfoy, and I’ll give you a real injury,”  snarled Ron.   “ — he’s complained to the school governors. And to  the Ministry of Magic. Father’s got a lot of influence,  you know. And a lasting injury like this” — he gave a  huge, fake sigh — “who knows if my arm’ll ever be the  same again? “So that’s why you’re putting it on,” said Harry,  accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his  hand was shaking in anger. “To try to get Hagrid  fired.”   “Well,” said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper,   “ partly , Potter. But there are other benefits too.  Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.”   A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville  regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his  worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape  made things ten times worse. His potion, which was  supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned —   “Orange, Longbottom,” said Snape, ladling some up  and allowing it to splash back into the cauldron, so  that everyone could see. “Orange. Tell me, boy, does  anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn’t  you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one rat  spleen was needed? Didn’t I state plainly that a dash  of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to  make you understand, Longbottom?”   Neville was pink and trembling. He looked as though  he was on the verge of tears.   “Please, sir,” said Hermione, “please, I could help  Neville put it right — ”   “I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss  Granger,” said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as  pink as Neville. “Longbottom, at the end of this lesson  we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad  and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage  you to do it properly.”   Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with  fear “Help me!” he moaned to Hermione “Hey, Harry,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to  borrow Harry’s brass scales, “have you heard? Daily  Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black’s  been sighted.”   “Where?” said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other  side of the table, Malfoy looked up, listening closely.   “Not too far from here,” said Seamus, who looked  excited. “It was a Muggle who saw him. ’Course, she  didn’t really understand. The Muggles think he’s just  an ordinary criminal, don’t they? So she phoned the  telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic  got there, he was gone.”   “Not too far from here ... ,” Ron repeated, looking  significantly at Harry. He turned around and saw  Malfoy watching closely. “What, Malfoy? Need  something else skinned?”   But Malfoy’s eyes were shining malevolently, and they  were fixed on Harry. He leaned across the table.   “Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed,  Potter?”   “Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry offhandedly.   Malfoy’s thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.   “Of course, if it was me,” he said quietly, “I’d have  done something before now. I wouldn’t be staying in  school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for  him.”   “What are you talking about, Malfoy?” said Ron  roughly “Don’t you know, Potter?” breathed Malfoy, his pale  eyes narrowed “Know what?”   Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.   “Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck,” he said.  “Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it  was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself.”   “ What are you talking about?” said Harry angrily, but  at that moment Snape called, “You should have  finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion  needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away  while it simmers and then we’ll test Longbottom’s. ...”   Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville  sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly. Hermione  was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of  her mouth, so that Snape wouldn’t see. Harry and  Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went  to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in  the corner.   “What did Malfoy mean?” Harry muttered to Ron as  he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from  the gargoyle’s mouth. “Why would I want revenge on  Black? He hasn’t done anything to me — yet.”   “He’s making it up,” said Ron savagely. “He’s trying to  make you do something stupid. ...”   The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to  Neville, who was cowering by his cauldron.   “Everyone gather ’round,” said Snape, his black eyes  glittering, “and watch what happens to Longbottom’s  toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinkin Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don’t  doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be  poisoned.”   The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins  looked excited. Snape picked up Trevor the toad in  his left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville’s  potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops  down Trevor’s throat.   There was a moment of hushed silence, in which  Trevor gulped; then there was a small pop, and Trevor  the tadpole was wriggling in Snape ’s palm.   The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking  sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his  robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and he  reappeared suddenly, fully grown.   “Five points from Gryffindor,” said Snape, which  wiped the smiles from every face. “I told you not to  help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.”   Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the  entrance hall. Harry was still thinking about what  Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about  Snape.   “Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was  all right! Why didn’t you lie, Hermione? You should’ve  said Neville did it all by himself!”   Hermione didn’t answer. Ron looked around.   “Where is she?”   Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps  now, watching the rest of the class pass them,  heading for the Great Hall and lunch “She was right behind us,” said Ron, frowning.   Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and  Goyle. He smirked at Harry and disappeared.   “There she is,” said Harry.   Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the  stairs; one hand clutched her bag, the other seemed  to be tucking something down the front of her robes.   “How did you do that?” said Ron.   “What?” said Hermione, joining them.   “One minute you were right behind us, the next  moment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs  again.”   “What?” Hermione looked slightly confused. “Oh — I  had to go back for something. Oh no — ”   A seam had split on Hermione’s bag. Harry wasn’t  surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at  least a dozen large and heavy books.   “Why are you carrying all these around with you?”  Ron asked her.   “You know how many subjects I’m taking,” said  Hermione breathlessly. “Couldn’t hold these for me,  could you?”   “But — ” Ron was turning over the books she had  handed him, looking at the covers. “You haven’t got  any of these subjects today. It’s only Defense Against  the Dark Arts this afternoon. “Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all  the books back into her bag just the same. “I hope  there’s something good for lunch, I’m starving,” she  added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.   “D’you get the feeling Hermione ’s not telling us  something?” Ron asked Harry Professor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at his  first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all  sat down, took out their books, quills, and  parchment, and were talking when he finally entered  the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty  old briefcase on the teacher’s desk. He was as shabby  as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train,  as though he had had a few square meals.   “Good afternoon,” he said. “Would you please put all  your books back in your bags. Today’s will be a  practical lesson. You will need only your wands.”   A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put  away their books. They had never had a practical  Defense Against the Dark Arts before, unless you  counted the memorable class last year when their old  teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and  set them loose.   “Right then,” said Professor Lupin, when everyone  was ready. “If you’d follow me.”   Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and  followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom. He led  them along the deserted corridor and around a  corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the  Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair  and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum Peeves didn’t look up until Professor Lupin was two  feet away; then he wiggled his curly-toed feet and  broke into song.   “Loony, loopy Lupin,” Peeves sang. “Loony, loopy  Lupin, loony, loopy Lupin — ”   Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was,  Peeves usually showed some respect toward the  teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin  to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he  was still smiling.   “I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you,  Peeves,” he said pleasantly. “Mr. Filch won’t be able to  get in to his brooms.”   Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered,  failed wizard who waged a constant war against the  students and, indeed, Peeves. However, Peeves paid  no attention to Professor Lupin’s words, except to  blow a loud wet raspberry.   Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his  wand.   “This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his  shoulder. “Please watch closely.”   He raised the wand to shoulder height, said,   “ Waddiwasil ” and pointed it at Peeves.   With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum  shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves ’s left  nostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing.   “Cool, sir!” said Dean Thomas in amazement “Thank you, Dean,” said Professor Lupin, putting his  wand away again. “Shall we proceed?”   They set off again, the class looking at shabby  Professor Lupin with increased respect. He led them  down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the  staffroom door.   “Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin, opening it and  standing back.   The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old,  mismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher.  Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and he  looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were  glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around  his mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to  close the door behind him, Snape said, “Leave it open,  Lupin. Td rather not witness this.”   He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black  robes billowing behind him. At the doorway he turned  on his heel and said, “Possibly no one’s warned you,  Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I  would advise you not to entrust him with anything  difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing  instructions in his ear.”   Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad  enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let  alone doing it in front of other teachers.   Professor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.   “I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the  first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure  he will perform it admirably. Neville’s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape’s  lip curled, but he left, shutting the door with a snap.   “Now, then,” said Professor Lupin, beckoning the  class toward the end of the room, where there was  nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept  their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand  next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble,  banging off the wall.   “Nothing to worry about,” said Professor Lupin calmly  because a few people had jumped backward in alarm.  “There’s a boggart in there.”   Most people seemed to feel that this was something to  worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of  pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now  rattling doorknob apprehensively.   “Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor  Lupin. “Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the  cupboards under sinks — I’ve even met one that had  lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in  yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if  the staff would leave it to give my third years some  practice.   “So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what  is a boggart?”   Hermione put up her hand.   “It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape  of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.”   “Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor  Lupin, and Hermione glowed. “So the boggart sitting  in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form.   He does not yet know what will frighten the person o the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a  boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let  him out, he will immediately become whatever each of  us most fears.   “This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to  ignore Neville’s small sputter of terror, “that we have a  huge advantage over the boggart before we begin.   Have you spotted it, Harry?”   Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to  him, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet  with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but  Harry had a go.   “Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know  what shape it should be?”   “Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put  her hand down, looking a little disappointed. “It’s  always best to have company when you’re dealing  with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should  he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I  once saw a boggart make that very mistake — tried to  frighten two people at once and turned himself into  half a slug. Not remotely frightening.   “The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it  requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really  finishes a boggart is laughter. What you need to do is  force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.   “We will practice the charm without wands first. After  me, please ... riddikulusV’   “ RiddikulusV’ said the class together.   “Good,” said Professor Lupin. “Very good. But that  was the easy part, I’m afraid. You see, the word alon is not enough. And this is where you come in,  Neville. The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as  Neville, who walked forward as though he were  heading for the gallows.   “Right, Neville,” said Professor Lupin. “First things  first: what would you say is the thing that frightens  you most in the world?”   Neville’s lips moved, but no noise came out.   “Didn’t catch that, Neville, sorry,” said Professor  Lupin cheerfully.   Neville looked around rather wildly, as though  begging someone to help him, then said, in barely  more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.”   Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned  apologetically. Professor Lupin, however, looked  thoughtful.   “Professor Snape ... hmmm ... Neville, I believe you  live with your grandmother?”   “Er — yes,” said Neville nervously. “But — I don’t  want the boggart to turn into her either.”   “No, no, you misunderstand me,” said Professor  Lupin, now smiling. “I wonder, could you tell us what  sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?”   Neville looked startled, but said, “Well ... always the  same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top.   And a long dress ... green, normally ... and sometimes  a fox-fur scarf. “And a handbag?” prompted Professor Lupin.   “A big red one,” said Neville.   “Right then,” said Professor Lupin. “Can you picture  those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them  in your mind’s eye?”   “Yes,” said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering  what was coming next.   “When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe,   Neville, and sees you, it will assume the form of  Professor Snape,” said Lupin. “And you will raise your  wand — thus — and cry ‘Riddikulus’ — and  concentrate hard on your grandmother’s clothes. If all  goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into  that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with  that big red handbag.”   There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe  wobbled more violently.   “If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift  his attention to each of us in turn,” said Professor  Lupin. “I would like all of you to take a moment now  to think of the thing that scares you most, and  imagine how you might force it to look comical. ...”   The room went quiet. Harry thought ... What scared  him most in the world?   His first thought was Lord Voldemort — a Voldemort  returned to full strength. But before he had even  started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart -  Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to the  surface of his mind. .. A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a  black cloak ... a long, rattling breath from an unseen  mouth . . . then a cold so penetrating it felt like  drowning. ...   Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one  had noticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight.  Ron was muttering to himself, “Take its legs off.”  Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron’s  greatest fear was spiders.   “Everyone ready?” said Professor Lupin.   Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn’t ready. How could  you make a dementor less frightening? But he didn’t  want to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding  and rolling up their sleeves.   “Neville, we’re going to back away,” said Professor  Lupin. “Let you have a clear field, all right? I’ll call the  next person forward. ... Everyone back, now, so  Neville can get a clear shot — ”   They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving  Neville alone beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and  frightened, but he had pushed up the sleeves of his  robes and was holding his wand ready.   “On the count of three, Neville,” said Professor Lupin,  who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the  wardrobe. “One — two — three — now\\”   A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin’s  wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst  open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape  stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing  wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him,  reaching inside his robes.   “R — r — riddikulusV’ squeaked Neville.   There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled;  he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a  towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and  he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.   There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused,  confused, and Professor Lupin shouted, “Parvati!  Forward!”   Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded  on her. There was another crack, and where he had  stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its  sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to  walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff  arms rising —   “RiddikulusV’ cried Parvati.   A bandage unraveled at the mummy’s feet; it became  entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.   “Seamus!” roared Professor Lupin.   Seamus darted past Parvati.   Crack ! Where the mummy had been was a woman  with floor-length black hair and a skeletal, green-  tinged face — a banshee. She opened her mouth wide  and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long,  wailing shriek that made the hair on Harry’s head  stand on end —   “RiddikulusV’ shouted Seamus The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her  throat; her voice was gone.   Crack). The banshee turned into a rat, which chased  its tail in a circle, then — crack). — became a  rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before —  crack ! — becoming a single, bloody eyeball.   “It’s confused!” shouted Lupin. “We’re getting there!  Dean!”   Dean hurried forward.   Crack) The eyeball became a severed hand, which  flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a  crab.   “RiddikulusV’ yelled Dean.   There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a  mousetrap.   “Excellent! Ron, you next!”   Ron leapt forward.   Crack)   Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet  tall and covered in hair, was advancing on Ron,  clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry  thought Ron had frozen. Then —   “RiddikulusV’ bellowed Ron, and the spider’s legs  vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown  squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt  at Harry’s feet. He raised his wand, ready, but  “Here!” shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying  forward.   Crack).   The legless spider had vanished. For a second,  everyone looked wildly around to see where it was.  Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air  in front of Lupin, who said, “RiddikulusV’ almost  lazily.   Crack !   “Forward, Neville, and finish him off!” said Lupin as  the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach. Crack).  Snape was back. This time Neville charged forward  looking determined.   “RiddikulusV’ he shouted, and they had a split  second’s view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville  let out a great “Ha!” of laughter, and the boggart  exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke,  and was gone.   “Excellent!” cried Professor Lupin as the class broke  into applause. “Excellent, Neville. Well done,  everyone. ... Let me see ... five points to Gryffindor for  every person to tackle the boggart — ten for Neville  because he did it twice . . . and five each to Hermione  and Harry.”   “But I didn’t do anything,” said Harry.   “You and Hermione answered my questions correctly  at the start of the class, Harry,” Lupin said lightly.  “Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework,  kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it  for me ... to be handed in on Monday. That will be  all. Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry,  however, wasn’t feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had  deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart.  Why? Was it because he’d seen Harry collapse on the  train, and thought he wasn’t up to much? Had he  thought Harry would pass out again?   But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.   “Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted  Seamus.   “And the hand!” said Dean, waving his own around.  “And Snape in that hat!”   “And my mummy!”   “I wonder why Professor Lupin’s frightened of crystal  balls?” said Lavender thoughtfully.   “That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts  lesson we’ve ever had, wasn’t it?” said Ron excitedly  as they made their way back to the classroom to get  their bags.   “He seems like a very good teacher,” said Hermione  approvingly. “But I wish I could have had a turn with  the boggart — ”   “What would it have been for you?” said Ron,  sniggering. “A piece of homework that only got nine  out of ten?  In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had  become most people’s favorite class. Only Draco  Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins had anything bad to  say about Professor Lupin.   “Look at the state of his robes,” Malfoy would say in a  loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed. “He dresses  like our old house-elf.”   But no one else cared that Professor Lupin’s robes  were patched and frayed. His next few lessons were  just as interesting as the first. After boggarts, they  studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures  that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in  the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted  battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten  lost. From Red Caps they moved on to kappas, creepy  water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with  webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in  their ponds.   Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his  other classes. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was i a particularly vindictive mood these days, and no one  was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart  assuming Snape’s shape, and the way that Neville  had dressed it in his grandmother’s clothes, had  traveled through the school like wildfire. Snape didn’t  seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at  the very mention of Professor Lupin’s name, and he  was bullying Neville worse than ever.   Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent  in Professor Trelawney’s stifling tower room,  deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols, trying to  ignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous eyes  filled with tears every time she looked at him. He  couldn’t like Professor Trelawney, even though she  was treated with respect bordering on reverence by  many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown  had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney’s tower  room at lunchtimes, and always returned with  annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though  they knew things the others didn’t. They had also  started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to  Harry, as though he were on his deathbed.   Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which,  after the action-packed first class, had become  extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to have lost his  confidence. They were now spending lesson after  lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which  had to be some of the most boring creatures in  existence.   “Why would anyone bother looking after them?” said  Ron, after yet another hour of poking shredded  lettuce down the flobberworms’ slimy throats.   At the start of October, however, Harry had  something else to occupy him, something so enjoyable  it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes The Quidditch season was approaching, and Oliver  Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor team, called a  meeting one Thursday evening to discuss tactics for  the new season.   There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three  Chasers, whose job it was to score goals by putting  the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through one of  the fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of the field; two  Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to repel  the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed  around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who  defended the goal posts, and the Seeker, who had the  hardest job of all, that of catching the Golden Snitch,  a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture  ended the game and earned the Seeker’s team an  extra one hundred and fifty points.   Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in  his seventh and final year at Hogwarts. There was a  quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed  his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms  on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field.   “This is our last chance — my last chance — to win  the Quidditch Cup,” he told them, striding up and  down in front of them. “I’ll be leaving at the end of  this year. I’ll never get another shot at it.   “Gryffindor hasn’t won for seven years now. Okay, so  we’ve had the worst luck in the world — injuries —  then the tournament getting called off last year. ...”  Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought  a lump to his throat. “But we also know we’ve got the  best — ruddy — team — in — the — school,” he said,  punching a fist into his other hand, the old manic  glint back in his eye.   “We’ve got three superb Chasers. Wood pointed at Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson,  and Katie Bell.   “We’ve got two unbeatable Beaters.”   “Stop it, Oliver, you’re embarrassing us,” said Fred  and George Weasley together, pretending to blush.   “And we’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win  us a match).” Wood rumbled, glaring at Harry with a  kind of furious pride. “And me,” he added as an  afterthought.   “We think you’re very good too, Oliver,” said George.   “Spanking good Keeper,” said Fred.   “The point is,” Wood went on, resuming his pacing,  “the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it  these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the  team, I’ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we  haven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get  to finally see our name on the thing. ...”   Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George  looked sympathetic.   “Oliver, this year’s our year,” said Fred.   “Well do it, Oliver!” said Angelina.   “Definitely,” said Harry.   Full of determination, the team started training  sessions, three evenings a week. The weather was  getting colder and wetter, the nights darker, but no  amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry’s  wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver  Quidditch Cup Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one  evening after training, cold and stiff but pleased with  the way practice had gone, to find the room buzzing  excitedly.   “What’s happened?” he asked Ron and Hermione,  who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the  fireside and completing some star charts for  Astronomy.   “First Hogsmeade weekend,” said Ron, pointing at a  notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin  board. “End of October. Halloween.”   “Excellent,” said Fred, who had followed Harry  through the portrait hole. “I need to visit Zonko’s. I’m  nearly out of Stink Pellets.”   Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high  spirits ebbing away. Hermione seemed to read his  mind.   “Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time,” she  said. “They’re bound to catch Black soon. He’s been  sighted once already”   “Black’s not fool enough to try anything in  Hogsmeade,” said Ron. “Ask McGonagall if you can go  this time, Harry. The next one might not be for age “Ron\\” said Hermione. “Harry’s supposed to stay in  school — ”   “He can’t be the only third year left behind,” said Ron.  “Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry — ”   “Yeah, I think I will,” said Harry, making up his mind Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that  moment Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap. A  large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.   “Does he have to eat that in front of us?” said Ron,  scowling.   “Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by  yourself?” said Hermione.   Crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow  eyes fixed insolently on Ron.   “Just keep him over there, that’s all,” said Ron  irritably, turning back to his star chart. “I’ve got  Scabbers asleep in my bag.”   Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he  still had his own star chart to complete. He pulled his  bag toward him, took out parchment, ink, and quill,  and started work.   “You can copy mine, if you like,” said Ron, labeling  his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart  toward Harry.   Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her  lips but didn’t say anything. Crookshanks was still  staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his  bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.   “OY!” Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks  sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began  tearing ferociously. “GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!”   Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but  Crookshanks clung on, spitting and slashing “Ron, don’t hurt him!” squealed Hermione; the whole  common room was watching; Ron whirled the bag  around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers  came flying out of the top —   “CATCH THAT CAT!” Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed  himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the  table, and chased after the terrified Scabbers.   George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but  missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of  legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers.  Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his  bandy legs, and started making furious swipes  beneath it with his front paw.   Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed  Crookshanks around the middle and heaved him  away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with  great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.   “Look at him!” he said furiously to Hermione,  dangling Scabbers in front of her. “He’s skin and  bone! You keep that cat away from him!”   “Crookshanks doesn’t understand it’s wrong!” said  Hermione, her voice shaking. “All cats chase rats,  Ron!”   “There’s something funny about that animal!” said  Ron, who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling  Scabbers back into his pocket. “It heard me say that  Scabbers was in my bag!”   “Oh, what rubbish,” said Hermione impatiently.  “Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else d’you  think —  “That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said Ron, ignoring  the people around him, who were starting to giggle.  “And Scabbers was here first, and he’s ill!”   Ron marched through the common room and out of  sight up the stairs to the boys’ dormitories.   Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day.  He barely talked to her all through Herbology, even  though he, Harry, and Hermione were working  together on the same puffapod.   “How’s Scabbers?” Hermione asked timidly as they  stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied  the shining beans into a wooden pail.   “He’s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,” said  Ron angrily, missing the pail and scattering beans  over the greenhouse floor.   “Careful, Weasley, careful!” cried Professor Sprout as  the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes.   They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had  resolved to ask Professor McGonagall after the lesson  whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the rest,  joined the line outside the class trying to decide how  he was going to argue his case. He was distracted,  however, by a disturbance at the front of the line.   Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her  arm around her and was explaining something to  Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were  looking very serious.   “What’s the matter, Lavender?” said Hermione  anxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join the  group “She got a letter from home this morning,” Parvati  whispered. “It’s her rabbit, Binky. He’s been killed by  a fox.”   “Oh,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, Lavender.”   “I should have known!” said Lavender tragically. “You  know what day it is?”   “Er —  “The sixteenth of October! That thing you’re dreading,  it will happen on the sixteenth of October!’  Remember? She was right, she was right!”   The whole class was gathered around Lavender now.  Seamus shook his head seriously. Hermione  hesitated; then she said, “You — you were dreading  Binky being killed by a fox?”   “Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender,  looking up at Hermione with streaming eyes, “but I  was obviously dreading him dying, wasn’t I?”   “Oh,” said Hermione. She paused again. Then —   “Was Binky an old rabbit?”   “N — no!” sobbed Lavender. “H — he was only a  baby!”   Parvati tightened her arm around Lavender’s  shoulders.   “But then, why would you dread him dying?” said  Hermione.   Parvati glared at her “Well, look at it logically,” said Hermione, turning to  the rest of the group. “I mean, Binky didn’t even die  today, did he? Lavender just got the news today — ”  Lavender wailed loudly. “ — and she can’t have been  dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock — ”   “Don’t mind Hermione, Lavender,” said Ron loudly,  “she doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very  much.”   Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at  that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione  and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and  when they got into class, they seated themselves on  either side of Harry and didn’t talk to each other for  the whole class.   Harry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to  Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of  the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject  of Hogsmeade first.   “One moment, please!” she called as the class made  to leave. “As you’re all in my House, you should hand  Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween.  No form, no visiting the village, so don’t forget!”   Neville put up his hand.   “Please, Professor, I — I think I’ve lost — ”   “Your grandmother sent yours to me directly,  Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “She  seemed to think it was safer. Well, that’s all, you may  leave.”   “Ask her now,” Ron hissed at Harry.   “Oh, but — ” Hermione began “Go for it, Harry,” said Ron stubbornly.   Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear,  then headed nervously for Professor McGonagall’s  desk.   “Yes, Potter?”   Harry took a deep breath.   “Professor, my aunt and uncle — er — forgot to sign  my form,” he said.   Professor McGonagall looked over her square  spectacles at him but didn’t say anything.   “So — er — d’you think it would be all right — I  mean, will it be okay if I — if I go to Hogsmeade?”   Professor McGonagall looked down and began  shuffling papers on her desk.   “I’m afraid not, Potter,” she said. “You heard what I  said. No form, no visiting the village. That’s the rule.”   “But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know,  they’re Muggles, they don’t really understand about  — about Hogwarts forms and stuff,” Harry said, while  Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. “If you said I  could go — ”   “But I don’t say so,” said Professor McGonagall,  standing up and piling her papers neatly into a  drawer. “The form clearly states that the parent or  guardian must give permission.” She turned to look at  him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity?  “I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s my final word. You had  better hurry, or you’ll be late for your next lesson. There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor  McGonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed  Hermione; Hermione assumed an “all-for-the-best”  expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry  had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly  and happily about what they were going to do first,  once they got into Hogsmeade.   “There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to  cheer Harry up. “You know, the Halloween feast, in  the evening.”   “Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.”   The Halloween feast was always good, but it would  taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in  Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing anyone said  made him feel any better about being left behind.  Dean Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered  to forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as  Harry had already told Professor McGonagall he  hadn’t had it signed, that was no good. Ron  halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but  Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what  Dumbledore had told them about the dementors  being able to see through them. Percy had what were  possibly the least helpful words of comfort.   “They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure  you, Harry, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he said  seriously. “All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and  Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the  Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really,  Harry, apart from that, you’re not missing anything.”   On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest  and went down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly  depressed, though doing his best to act normally “Well bring you lots of sweets back from  Honeydukes,” said Hermione, looking desperately  sorry for him.   “Yeah, loads,” said Ron. He and Hermione had finally  forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the  face of Harry’s difficulties.   “Don’t worry about me,” said Harry, in what he hoped  was an offhand voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a  good time.”   He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where  Filch, the caretaker, was standing inside the front  doors, checking off names against a long list, peering  suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no  one was sneaking out who shouldn’t be going.   “Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was  standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of  passing the dementors?”   Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the  marble staircase, through the deserted corridors, and  back to Gryffindor Tower.   “Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.   “Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly.   The portrait swung open and he climbed through the  hole into the common room. It was full of chattering  first and second years, and a few older students, who  had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty  had worn off.   “Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry! It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in  awe of Harry and never missed an opportunity to  speak to him.   “Aren’t you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not?  Hey” — Colin looked eagerly around at his friends —  “you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!”   “Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said Harry, who wasn’t in  the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the  scar on his forehead. “I — I’ve got to go to the library,  got to get some work done.”   After that, he had no choice but to turn right around  and head back out of the portrait hole again.   “What was the point waking me up?” the Fat Lady  called grumpily after him as he walked away.   Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but  halfway there he changed his mind; he didn’t feel like  working. He turned around and came face-to-face  with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of  the Hogsmeade visitors.   “What are you doing?” Filch snarled suspiciously.   “Nothing,” said Harry truthfully.   “Nothing!” spat Filch, his jowls quivering  unpleasantly. “A likely story! Sneaking around on  your own — why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buying  Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms  like the rest of your nasty little friends?”   Harry shrugged “Well, get back to your common room where you  belong!” snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until  Harry had passed out of sight.   But Harry didn’t go back to the common room; he  climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the  Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another  corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms  said, “Harry?”   Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met  Professor Lupin, looking around his office door.   “What are you doing?” said Lupin, though in a very  different voice from Filch. “Where are Ron and  Hermione?”   “Hogsmeade,” said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.   “Ah,” said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment.  “Why don’t you come in? I’ve just taken delivery of a  grindylow for our next lesson.”   “A what?” said Harry.   He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a  very large tank of water. A sickly green creature with  sharp little horns had its face pressed against the  glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly  fingers.   “Water demon,” said Lupin, surveying the grindylow  thoughtfully. “We shouldn’t have much difficulty with  him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his  grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong,  but very brittle.”   The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried  itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner “Cup of tea?” Lupin said, looking around for his  kettle. “I was just thinking of making one.”   “All right,” said Harry awkwardly.   Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of  steam issued suddenly from the spout.   “Sit down,” said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin.  “I’ve only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay  you’ve had enough of tea leaves?”   Harry looked at him. Lupin’s eyes were twinkling.   “How did you know about that?” Harry asked.   “Professor McGonagall told me,” said Lupin, passing  Harry a chipped mug of tea. “You’re not worried, are  you?”   “No,” said Harry.   He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the  dog he’d seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not  to. He didn’t want Lupin to think he was a coward,  especially since Lupin already seemed to think he  couldn’t cope with a boggart.   Something of Harry’s thoughts seemed to have shown  on his face, because Lupin said, “Anything worrying  you, Harry?”   “No,” Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched  the grindylow brandishing a fist at him. “Yes,” he said  suddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin’s desk. “You  know that day we fought the boggart?   “Yes,” said Lupin slowly “Why didn’t you let me fight it?” said Harry abruptly.  Lupin raised his eyebrows.   “I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,” he  said, sounding surprised.   Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he’d  done any such thing, was taken aback.   “Why?” he said again.   “Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that  if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of  Lord Voldemort.”   Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he’d  expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort ’s name. The  only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud  (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.   “Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at  Harry. “But I didn’t think it a good idea for Lord  Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined  that people would panic.”   “I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly. “I  — I remembered those dementors.”   “I see,” said Lupin thoughtfully. “Well, well ... I’m  impressed.” He smiled slightly at the look of surprise  on Harry’s face. “That suggests that what you fear  most of all is — fear. Very wise, Harry.”   Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he drank  some more tea.   “So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you  capable of fighting the boggart?” said Lupin shrewdly “Well ... yeah,” said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a  lot happier. “Professor Lupin, you know the  dementors — ”   He was interrupted by a knock on the door.   “Come in,” called Lupin.   The door opened, and in came Snape. He was  carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and  stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes  narrowing.   “Ah, Severus,” said Lupin, smiling. “Thanks very  much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?”   Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes  wandering between Harry and Lupin.   “I was just showing Harry my grindylow,” said Lupin  pleasantly, pointing at the tank.   “Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it. “You  should drink that directly, Lupin.”   “Yes, yes, I will,” said Lupin.   “I made an entire cauldronful,” Snape continued. “If  you need more.”   “I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks  very much, Severus.”   “Not at all,” said Snape, but there was a look in his  eye Harry didn’t like. He backed out of the room,  unsmiling and watchful.   Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled “Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion  for me,” he said. “I have never been much of a potion-  brewer and this one is particularly complex.” He  picked up the goblet and sniffed it. “Pity sugar makes  it useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering.   “Why — ?” Harry began. Lupin looked at him and  answered the unfinished question.   “I’ve been feeling a bit off-color,” he said. “This potion  is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be  working alongside Professor Snape; there aren’t many  wizards who are up to making it.”   Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a  crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands.   “Professor Snape’s very interested in the Dark Arts,”  he blurted out.   “Really?” said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as  he took another gulp of potion.   “Some people reckon — ” Harry hesitated, then  plunged recklessly on, “some people reckon he’d do  anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts  job.”   Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.   “Disgusting,” he said. “Well, Harry, I’d better get back  to work. I’ll see you at the feast later.”   “Right,” said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.   The empty goblet was still smoking.   “There you go,” said Ron. “We got as much as we  could carry. A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry’s  lap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just  turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the  cold wind and looking as though they’d had the time  of their lives.   “Thanks,” said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny  black Pepper Imps. “What’s Hogsmeade like? Where  did you go?”   By the sound of it — everywhere. Dervish and  Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko’s Joke  Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of  hot butterbeer, and many places besides.   “The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all  sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how  fast you want your letter to get there!”   “Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were  giving out free samples, there’s a bit, look — ”   “We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts  at the Three Broomsticks — ”   “Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer,  really warms you up — ”   “What did you do?” said Hermione, looking anxious.  “Did you get any work done?”   “No,” said Harry. “Lupin made me a cup of tea in his  office. And then Snape came in. ...”   He told them all about the goblet. Ron’s mouth fell  open.   “ Lupin drank it?” he gasped. “Is he mad? Hermione checked her watch “We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be  starting in five minutes. ...” They hurried through the  portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing  Snape.   “But if he — you know” — Hermione dropped her  voice, glancing nervously around — “if he was trying  to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t have done it in  front of Harry.”   “Yeah, maybe,” said Harry as they reached the  entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It had  been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of  candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats,  and many flaming orange streamers, which were  swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant  watersnakes.   The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who  were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets,  managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept  glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin looked  cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking  animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the  Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the  table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining  it, or were Snape ’s eyes flickering toward Lupin more  often than was natural?   The feast finished with an entertainment provided by  the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls  and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly  Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great  success with a reenactment of his own botched  beheading It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good  mood couldn’t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who  shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall,  “The dementors send their love, Potter!”   Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the  Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower,  but when they reached the corridor that ended with  the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed  with students.   “Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously.   Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The  portrait seemed to be closed.   “Let me through, please,” came Percy’s voice, and he  came bustling importantly through the crowd.   “What’s the holdup here? You can’t all have forgotten  the password — excuse me, I’m Head Boy — ”   And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front  first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the  corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp  voice, “Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.”   People’s heads turned; those at the back were  standing on tiptoe.   “What’s going on?” said Ginny, who had just arrived.   A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there,  sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors  squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron,  and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble  was.   “Oh, my — ” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which  had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas  littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn  away completely.   Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined  painting and turned, his eyes somber, to see  Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying  toward him.   “We need to find her,” said Dumbledore. “Professor  McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell  him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat  Lady.”   “You’ll be lucky!” said a cackling voice.   It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd  and looking delighted, as he always did, at the sight  of wreckage or worry.   “What do you mean, Peeves?” said Dumbledore  calmly, and Peeves’s grin faded a little. He didn’t dare  taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice  that was no better than his cackle.   “Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn’t want to be  seen. She’s a horrible mess. Saw her running through  the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging  between the trees. Crying something dreadful,” he  said happily. “Poor thing,” he added unconvincingly.   “Did she say who did it?” said Dumbledore quietly.   “Oh yes, Professorhead,” said Peeves, with the air of  one cradling a large bombshell in his arms. “He got  very angry when she wouldn’t let him in, you see.”  Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore fro between his own legs. “Nasty temper he’s got, that  Sirius Black.  Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to  the Great Hall, where they were joined ten minutes  later by the students from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and  Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.   “The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough  search of the castle,” Professor Dumbledore told them  as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all  doors into the hall. “I’m afraid that, for your own  safety, you will have to spend the night here. I want  the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the  hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in  charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me  immediately,” he added to Percy, who was looking  immensely proud and important. “Send word with one  of the ghosts.”   Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall,  and said, “Oh, yes, you’ll be needing ...”   One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew  to the edges of the hall and stood themselves agains the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered  with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.   “Sleep well,” said Professor Dumbledore, closing the  door behind him.   The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the  Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what  had just happened.   “Everyone into their sleeping bags!” shouted Percy.  “Come on, now, no more talking! Lights out in ten  minutes!”   “C’mon,” Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized  three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner.   “Do you think Black’s still in the castle?” Hermione  whispered anxiously.   “Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,” said Ron.   “It’s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,” said  Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their  sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows  to talk. “The one night we weren’t in the tower. ...”   “I reckon he’s lost track of time, being on the run,”  said Ron. “Didn’t realize it was Halloween. Otherwise  he’d have come bursting in here.”   Hermione shuddered.   All around them, people were asking one another the  same question: “How did he get in?”   “Maybe he knows how to Apparate,” said a Ravenclaw  a few feet away. “Just appear out of thin air, you  know. “Disguised himself, probably,” said a Hufflepuff fifth  year.   “He could’ve flown in,” suggested Dean Thomas.   “Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered  to read Hogwarts, A History?” said Hermione crossly  to Harry and Ron.   “Probably,” said Ron. “Why?”   “Because the castle’s protected by more than walls,  you know,” said Hermione. “There are all sorts of  enchantments on it, to stop people entering by  stealth. You can’t just Apparate in here. And I’d like  to see the disguise that could fool those dementors.  They’re guarding every single entrance to the  grounds. They’d have seen him fly in too. And Filch  knows all the secret passages, they’ll have them  covered. ...”   “The lights are going out now!” Percy shouted. “I want  everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!”   The candles all went out at once. The only light now  came from the silvery ghosts, who were drifting about  talking seriously to the prefects, and the enchanted  ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was scattered  with stars. What with that, and the whispering that  still filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were  sleeping outdoors in a light wind.   Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall  to check that everything was quiet. Around three in  the morning, when many students had finally fallen  asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched  him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling  between the sleeping bags, telling people off for  talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry Ron, and Hermione, who quickly pretended to be  asleep as Dumbledore’s footsteps drew nearer.   “Any sign of him, Professor?” asked Percy in a  whisper.   “No. All well here?”   “Everything under control, sir.”   “Good. There’s no point moving them all now. I’ve  found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor  portrait hole. You’ll be able to move them back in  tomorrow.”   “And the Fat Lady, sir?”   “Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor.  Apparently she refused to let Black in without the  password, so he attacked. She’s still very distressed,  but once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr. Filch  restore her.”   Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again,  and more footsteps.   “Headmaster?” It was Snape. Harry kept quite still,  listening hard. “The whole of the third floor has been  searched. He’s not there. And Filch has done the  dungeons; nothing there either.”   “What about the Astronomy tower? Professor  Trelawney’s room? The Owlery?”   “All searched ...”   “Very well, Severus. I didn’t really expect Black to  linger. “Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?”  asked Snape.   Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free  his other ear.   “Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the  next.”   Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to  where they stood; Dumbledore ’s back was to him, but  he could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and  Snape ’s profile, which looked angry.   “You remember the conversation we had,   Headmaster, just before — ah — the start of term?”  said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as  though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.   “I do, Severus,” said Dumbledore, and there was  something like warning in his voice.   “It seems — almost impossible — that Black could  have entered the school without inside help. I did  express my concerns when you appointed — ”   “I do not believe a single person inside this castle  would have helped Black enter it,” said Dumbledore,  and his tone made it so clear that the subject was  closed that Snape didn’t reply. “I must go down to the  dementors,” said Dumbledore. “I said I would inform  them when our search was complete.”   “Didn’t they want to help, sir?” said Percy.   “Oh yes,” said Dumbledore coldly. “But I’m afraid no  dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I  am headmaster. Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the  hall, walking quickly and quietly. Snape stood for a  moment, watching the headmaster with an expression  of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.   Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of  them had their eyes open too, reflecting the starry  ceiling.   “What was all that about?” Ron mouthed.   The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the  next few days. The theories about how he had entered  the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott,  from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology  class telling anyone who’d listen that Black could  turn into a flowering shrub.   The Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the  wall and replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan  and his fat gray pony. Nobody was very happy about  this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging  people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously  complicated passwords, which he changed at least  twice a day.   “He’s a complete lunatic,” said Seamus Finnigan  angrily to Percy. “Can’t we get anyone else?”   “None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said  Percy. “Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady.  Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to  volunteer.”   Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry’s  worries. He was now being closely watched. Teachers  found excuses to walk along corridors with him, and  Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his  mother’s orders) was tailing him everywhere like a extremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all, Professor  McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with  such a somber expression on her face Harry thought  someone must have died.   “There’s no point hiding it from you any longer,  Potter,” she said in a very serious voice. “I know this  will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black — ”   “I know he’s after me,” said Harry wearily. “I heard  Ron’s dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the  Ministry of Magic.”   Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She  stared at Harry for a moment or two, then said, “I see!  Well, in that case, Potter, you’ll understand why I  don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be practicing  Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only  your team members, it’s very exposed, Potter — ”   “We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry,  outraged. “I’ve got to train, Professor!”   Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry  knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor  team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d  suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited,  holding his breath.   “Hmm ...” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared  out of the window at the Quidditch field, just visible  through the rain. “Well ... goodness knows, I’d like to  see us win the Cup at last ... but all the same, Potter  ... I’d be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask  Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.”   The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch  match drew nearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team  was training harder than ever under the eye o Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session  before Saturday’s match, Oliver Wood gave his team  some unwelcome news.   “We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking  very angry. “Flint’s just been to see me. We’re playing  Hufflepuff instead.”   “Why?” chorused the rest of the team.   “Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still  injured,” said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously. “But  it’s obvious why they’re doing it. Don’t want to play in  this weather. Think it’ll damage their chances. ...”   There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day,  and as Wood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of  thunder.   “There’s nothing wrong with Malfoy’s arm!” said Harry  furiously. “He’s faking it!”   “I know that, but we can’t prove it,” said Wood  bitterly. “And we’ve been practicing all those moves  assuming we’re playing Slytherin, and instead it’s  Hufflepuff, and their style’s quite different. They’ve got  a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory — ”   Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.   “What?” said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted  behavior.   “He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said  Angelina.   “Strong and silent,” said Katie, and they started to  giggle again “He’s only silent because he’s too thick to string two  words together,” said Fred impatiently. “I don’t know  why you’re worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover.  Last time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in  about five minutes, remember?”   “We were playing in completely different conditions!”  Wood shouted, his eyes bulging slightly. “Diggory’s  put a very strong side together! He’s an excellent  Seeker! I was afraid you’d take it like this! We mustn’t  relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to  wrong-foot us! We must win!”   “Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, looking slightly  alarmed. “We’re taking Hufflepuff very seriously.  Seriously.”   The day before the match, the winds reached howling  point and the rain fell harder than ever. It was so  dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra  torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team was  looking very smug indeed, and none more so than  Malfoy.   “Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed  as the gale outside pounded the windows.   Harry had no room in his head to worry about  anything except the match tomorrow. Oliver Wood  kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving  him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked  for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten  minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and  set off at a run with Wood shouting after him,  “Diggory’s got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might  want to try looping him —  Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against  the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and  dashed inside.   “Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin, I — ”   But it wasn’t Professor Lupin who looked up at him  from the teacher’s desk; it was Snape.   “This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think  we’ll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.”   But Harry didn’t move.   “Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said.   “He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said  Snape with a twisted smile. “I believe I told you to sit  down?”   But Harry stayed where he was.   “What’s wrong with him?”   Snape ’s black eyes glittered.   “Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though  he wished it were. “Five more points from Gryffindor,  and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be  fifty.”   Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape  looked around at the class.   “As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor  Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have  covered so far —  “Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas,  and grindylows,” said Hermione quickly, “and we’re  just about to start — ”   “Be quiet,” said Snape coldly. “I did not ask for  information. I was merely commenting on Professor  Lupin’s lack of organization.”   “He’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher  we’ve ever had,” said Dean Thomas boldly, and there  was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the  class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.   “You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing  you — I would expect first years to be able to deal  with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall  discuss — ”   Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the  very back chapter, which he must know they hadn’t  covered.   “ — werewolves,” said Snape.   “But, sir,” said Hermione, seemingly unable to  restrain herself, “we’re not supposed to do werewolves  yet, we’re due to start hinkypunks — ”   “Miss Granger,” said Snape in a voice of deadly calm,  “I was under the impression that I am teaching this  lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to  page 394.” He glanced around again. “All of you!   Now\\”   With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen  muttering, the class opened their books.   “Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between  the werewolf and the true wolf?” said Snape Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except  Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot  straight into the air.   “Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted  smile was back. “Are you telling me that Professor  Lupin hasn’t even taught you the basic distinction  between — ”   “We told you,” said Parvati suddenly, “we haven’t got  as far as werewolves yet, we’re still on — ”   “Silencel” snarled Snape. “Well, well, well, I never  thought I’d meet a third -year class who wouldn’t even  recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make  a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very  behind you all are. ...”   “Please, sir,” said Hermione, whose hand was still in  the air, “the werewolf differs from the true wolf in  several small ways. The snout of the werewolf — ”   “That is the second time you have spoken out of turn,  Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points  from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”   Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and  stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a  mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they  were all glaring at him, because every one of them  had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and  Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least  twice a week, said loudly, “You asked us a question  and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want  to be told?”   The class knew instantly he’d gone too far. Snape  advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its  breath “Detention, Weasley,” Snape said silkily, his face very  close to Ron’s. “And if I ever hear you criticize the way  I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.”   No one made a sound throughout the rest of the  lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from  the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the  rows of desks, examining the work they had been  doing with Professor Lupin.   “Very poorly explained . . . That is incorrect, the kappa  is more commonly found in Mongolia. . . . Professor  Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn’t have given  it three. ...”   When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.   “You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me,  on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want  two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want  them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took  this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to  arrange your detention.”   Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the  class, who waited until they were well out of earshot,  then burst into a furious tirade about Snape.   “Snape ’s never been like this with any of our other  Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did  want the job,” Harry said to Hermione. “Why’s he got  it in for Lupin? D’you think this is all because of the  boggart?”   “I don’t know,” said Hermione pensively. “But I really  hope Professor Lupin gets better soon. ...”   Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a  towering rage “D’you know what that — ” (he called Snape  something that made Hermione say “Ron\\”) “ — is  making me do? I’ve got to scrub out the bedpans in  the hospital wing. Without magid” He was breathing  deeply, his fists clenched. “Why couldn’t Black have  hidden in Snape’s office, eh? He could have finished  him off for us!”   Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early  that it was still dark. For a moment he thought the  roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a  cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt  upright — Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating  next to him, blowing hard in his ear.   “What did you do that for?” said Harry furiously.   Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed  backward out of the room, cackling.   Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It  was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and  tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now  that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the  thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind  against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of  the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he  would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through  that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more  sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two  Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory.   As Harry opened the door, something brushed against  his leg. He bent down just in time to grab  Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag  him outside.   “You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry  told Crookshanks suspiciously. “There are plenty o mice around this place — go and chase them. Go on,”  he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral  staircase with his foot. “Leave Scabbers alone.”   The noise of the storm was even louder in the  common room. Harry knew better than to think the  match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren’t  called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless,  he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had  pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor;  Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry.  Seekers were usually light and speedy, but Diggory’s  weight would be an advantage in this weather  because he was less likely to be blown off course.   Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of  the fire, getting up every now and then to stop  Crookshanks from sneaking up the boys’ staircase  again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for  breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole  alone.   “Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan.  “Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned.   He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by  the time he’d started on toast, the rest of the team  had turned up.   “It’s going to be a tough one,” said Wood, who wasn’t  eating anything.   “Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we  don’t mind a bit of rain.”   But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such  was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school  turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ra down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads  bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being  whipped out of their hands as they went. Just before  he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy,   Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from  under an enormous umbrella on their way to the  stadium.   The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited  for Wood’s usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn’t  come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd  gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and  beckoned them to follow him.   The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways  as they walked out onto the field. If the crowd was  cheering, they couldn’t hear it over the fresh rolls of  thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry’s glasses.  How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?   The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite  side of the field, wearing canary -yellow robes. The  Captains walked up to each other and shook hands;  Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood now looked as  though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw  Madam Hooch’s mouth form the words, “Mount your  brooms.” He pulled his right foot out of the mud with  a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two  Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips  and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant —  they were off.   Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly  with the wind. He held it as steady as he could and  turned, squinting into the rain.   Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and  frozen, hardly able to see his teammates, let alone the  tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across th field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea  of what was happening in the rest of the game. He  couldn’t hear the commentary over the wind. The  crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and  battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to  being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so  clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn’t seen  them coming.   He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder  to hold his broom straight. The sky was getting  darker, as though night had decided to come early.  Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without  knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent;  everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he  could hardly tell them apart. ...   With the first flash of lightning came the sound of  Madam Hooch’s whistle; Harry could just see the  outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him  to the ground. The whole team splashed down into  the mud.   “I called for time-out!” Wood roared at his team.   “Come on, under here — ”   They huddled at the edge of the field under a large  umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them  hurriedly on his robes.   “What’s the score?”   “We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get  the Snitch soon, we’ll be playing into the night.”   “I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said  exasperatedly, waving his glasses At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his  shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head  and was, inexplicably, beaming.   “I’ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!”   He handed them to her, and as the team watched in  amazement, Hermione tapped them with her wand  and said, “Imperviusl”   “There!” she said, handing them back to Harry.  “They’ll repel water!”   Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.   “Brilliant!” he called hoarsely after her as she  disappeared into the crowd. “Okay, team, let’s go for  it! Hermione ’s spell had done the trick. Harry was still  numb with cold, still wetter than he’d ever been in his  life, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he  urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in  every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger,  ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the  opposite direction. ...   There was another clap of thunder, followed  immediately by forked lightning. This was getting  more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the  Snitch quickly —   He turned, intending to head back toward the middle  of the field, but at that moment, another flash of  lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw  something that distracted him completely — the  silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly  imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost,  empty row of seats Harry’s numb hands slipped on the broom handle  and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his  sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back into  the stands. The dog had vanished.   “Harry!” came Wood’s anguished yell from the  Gryffindor goal posts. “Harry, behind you!”   Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was  pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was  shimmering in the rain-filled air between them —   With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the  broom-handle and zoomed toward the Snitch.   “Come on!” he growled at his Nimbus as the rain  whipped his face. “Fasteri”   But something odd was happening. An eerie silence  was falling across the stadium. The wind, though as  strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as  though someone had turned off the sound, as though  Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on?   And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over  him, inside him, just as he became aware of  something moving on the field below. . . .   Before he’d had time to think, Harry had taken his  eyes off the Snitch and looked down.   At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces  pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It  was as though freezing water were rising in his chest,  cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. ...  Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head  ... a woman . . .   “Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry\\ “ Stand aside, you silly girl ... stand aside, now. ... “ Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead — ”   Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry’s  brain. . . . What was he doing? Why was he flying? He  needed to help her. ... She was going to die. ... She  was going to be murdered. ...   He was falling, falling through the icy mist.   “Not Harry\\ Please ... have mercy ... have mercy. ...”   A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was  screaming, and Harry knew no more.   “Lucky the ground was so soft.”   “I thought he was dead for sure.”   “But he didn’t even break his glasses.”   Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they  made no sense whatsoever. He didn’t have a clue  where he was, or how he’d got there, or what he’d  been doing before he got there. All he knew was that  every inch of him was aching as though it had been  beaten.   “That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”   Scariest . . . the scariest thing . . . hooded black figures  ... cold ... screaming ...   Harry’s eyes snapped open. He was lying in the  hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team,  spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered  around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there looking as though they’d just climbed out of a  swimming pool.   “Harry!” said Fred, who looked extremely white  underneath the mud. “How’re you feeling?”   It was as though Harry’s memory was on fast forward.  The lightning — the Grim — the Snitch — and the  dementors ...   “What happened?” he said, sitting up so suddenly  they all gasped.   “You fell off,” said Fred. “Must’ve been — what — fifty  feet?”   “We thought you’d died,” said Alicia, who was  shaking.   Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were  extremely bloodshot.   “But the match,” said Harry. “What happened? Are we  doing a replay?”   No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into  Harry like a stone.   “We didn’t — lose?”   “Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you  fell. He didn’t realize what had happened. When he  looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to  call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and  square ... even Wood admits it.”   “Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he  wasn’t there “Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he’s trying  to drown himself.”   Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping  his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it  roughly.   “C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch  before.”   “There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said  George.   “It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred  points, right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and  we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ...”   “Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred  points,” said George.   “But if they beat Ravenclaw ...”   “No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses  against Hufflepuff ...”   “It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred  either way — ”   Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost ...  for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.   After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to  tell the team to leave him in peace.   “Well come and see you later,” Fred told him. “Don’t  beat yourself up, Harry, you’re still the best Seeker  we’ve ever had. The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them.  Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking  disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to  Harry’s bed.   “Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a  quaking voice. “I’ve never seen him like that before.   He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and  you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground.  Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot  silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away.  ... He was furious they’d come onto the grounds. We  heard him — ”   “Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,” said Ron.  “And walked up to school with you floating on it.  Everyone thought you were ...”   His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was  thinking about what the dementors had done to him  ... about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw  Ron and Hermione looking at him so anxiously that  he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to  say.   “Did someone get my Nimbus?”   Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.   “Er —  “What?” said Harry, looking from one to the other.   “Well ... when you fell off, it got blown away,” said  Hermione hesitantly.   “And? “And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the  Whomping Willow.”   Harry’s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a  very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the  grounds.   “And?” he said, dreading the answer.   “Well, you know the Whomping Willow,” said Ron. “It  — it doesn’t like being hit.”   “Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you  came around,” said Hermione in a very small voice.   Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned  it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered  wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of  Harry’s faithful, finally beaten broomstick 1 THE MARAUDER’S Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the  hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn’t  argue or complain, but he wouldn’t let her throw  away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two  Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that  the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn’t  help it; he felt as though he’d lost one of his best  friends.   He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him  up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that  looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley,  blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she  had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry  kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor  team visited again on Sunday morning, this time  accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow,  dead sort of voice) that he didn’t blame him in the  slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry’s bedside only  at night. But nothing anyone said or did could make  Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of  what was troubling him He hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron  and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic  and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained,  however, that it had now appeared twice, and both  appearances had been followed by near-fatal  accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over  by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from  his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him  until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest  of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?   And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick  and humiliated every time he thought of them.  Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but no  one else collapsed every time they went near one. No  one else heard echoes in their head of their dying  parents.   Because Harry knew who that screaming voice  belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard  them over and over again during the night hours in  the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the  strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the  dementors approached him, he heard the last  moments of his mother’s life, her attempts to protect  him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort’s  laughter before he murdered her. . . . Harry dozed  fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted  hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell  again on his mother’s voice.   It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the  main school on Monday, where he was forced to think  about other things, even if he had to endure Draco  Malfoy’s taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself  with glee at Gryffindor’s defeat. He had finally taken  off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of  both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry  falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their nex Potions class doing dementor imitations across the  dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large,  slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in  the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from  Gryffindor.   “If Snape’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts  again, I’m skiving off,” said Ron as they headed  toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch. “Check who’s  in there, Hermione.”   Hermione peered around the classroom door.   “It’s okay!”   Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked  as though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging  more loosely on him and there were dark shadows  beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class  as they took their seats, and they burst at once into  an explosion of complaints about Snape’s behavior  while Lupin had been ill.   “It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give  us homework?”   “We don’t know anything about werewolves — ”   “ — two rolls of parchment!”   “Did you tell Professor Snape we haven’t covered them  yet?” Lupin asked, frowning slightly.   The babble broke out again.   “Yes, but he said we were really behind — ”   “ — he wouldn’t listen —  “ — two rolls of parchmenti Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on  every face.   “Don’t worry. I’ll speak to Professor Snape. You don’t  have to do the essay.”   “Oh no,” said Hermione, looking very disappointed.  “I’ve already finished it!”   They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin  had brought along a glass box containing a  hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as  though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail  and harmless-looking.   “Lures travelers into bogs,” said Professor Lupin as  they took notes. “You notice the lantern dangling from  his hand? Hops ahead — people follow the light —  then — ’ ”   The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise  against the glass.   When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things  and headed for the door, Harry among them, but —   “Wait a moment, Harry,” Lupin called. “I’d like a  word.”   Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin  covering the hinkypunk’s box with a cloth.   “I heard about the match,” said Lupin, turning back  to his desk and starting to pile books into his  briefcase, “and I’m sorry about your broomstick. Is  there any chance of fixing it? “No,” said Harry. “The tree smashed it to bits.”   Lupin sighed.   “They planted the Whomping Willow the same year  that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a  game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In  the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an  eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No  broomstick would have a chance.   “Did you hear about the dementors too?” said Harry  with difficulty.   Lupin looked at him quickly.   “Yes, I did. I don’t think any of us have seen Professor  Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing  restless for some time ... furious at his refusal to let  them inside the grounds. ... I suppose they were the  reason you fell?”   “Yes,” said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question  he had to ask burst from him before he could stop  himself. “ Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I  just — ? “It has nothing to do with weakness,” said Professor  Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry’s mind.  “The dementors affect you worse than the others  because there are horrors in your past that the others  don’t have.”   A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom,  illuminating Lupin’s gray hairs and the lines on his  young face.   “Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk  this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace,  hope, and happiness out of the air around them.   Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t  see them. Get too near a dementor and every good  feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of  you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long  enough to reduce you to something like itself . . . soul-  less and evil. You’ll be left with nothing but the worst  experiences of your life. And the worst that happened  to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their  broom. You have nothing to feel ashamed of.”   “When they get near me — ” Harry stared at Lupin’s  desk, his throat tight. “I can hear Voldemort  murdering my mum.”   Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though  to grip Harry’s shoulder, but thought better of it.   There was a moment’s silence, then —   “Why did they have to come to the match?” said Harry  bitterly.   “They’re getting hungry,” said Lupin coolly, shutting  his briefcase with a snap. “Dumbledore won’t let them  into the school, so their supply of human prey has  dried up. ... I don’t think they could resist the large  crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement  . . . emotions running high ... it was their idea of a  feast.”   “Azkaban must be terrible,” Harry muttered. Lupin  nodded grimly.   “The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea,  but they don’t need walls and water to keep the  prisoners in, not when they’re all trapped inside their  own heads, incapable of a single cheerful thought.  Most of them go mad within weeks. “But Sirius Black escaped from them,” Harry said  slowly. “He got away. ... Lupin’s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to  stoop quickly to catch it.   “Yes,” he said, straightening up, “Black must have  found a way to fight them. I wouldn’t have believed it  possible. ... Dementors are supposed to drain a  wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long “You made that dementor on the train back off,” said  Harry suddenly.   “There are — certain defenses one can use,” said  Lupin. “But there was only one dementor on the train.  The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to  resist.”   “What defenses?” said Harry at once. “Can you teach  me?”   “I don’t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors,  Harry ... quite the contrary. ...”   “But if the dementors come to another Quidditch  match, I need to be able to fight them — ”   Lupin looked into Harry’s determined face, hesitated,  then said, “Well ... all right. I’ll try and help. But it’ll  have to wait until next term, I’m afraid. I have a lot to  do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient  time to fall ill.”   What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from  Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear  his mother’s death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw  flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at th end of November, Harry’s mood took a definite  upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after  all, although they could not afford to lose another  match. Wood became repossessed of his manic  energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the  chilly haze of rain that persisted into December.   Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.  Dumbledore’s anger seemed to be keeping them at  their stations at the entrances.   Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky  lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and  the muddy grounds were revealed one morning  covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was  a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the  Charms teacher, had already decorated his classroom  with shimmering lights that turned out to be real,  fluttering fairies. The students were all happily  discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and  Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and  though Ron said it was because he couldn’t stand two  weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed  to use the library, Harry wasn’t fooled; they were  doing it to keep him company, and he was very  grateful.   To everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be  another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of  the term.   “We can do all our Christmas shopping there!” said  Hermione. “Mum and Dad would really love those  Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!”   Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third  year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of  Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend  the day reading up on the different makes. He had  been riding one of the school brooms at tea practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very  slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of  his own On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip,  Harry bid good-bye to Ron and Hermione, who were  wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the  marble staircase alone, and headed back toward  Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the  windows, and the castle was very still and quiet.   “Psst — Harry!”   He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to  see Fred and George peering out at him from behind a  statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch.   “What are you doing?” said Harry curiously. “How  come you’re not going to Hogsmeade?”   “We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before  we go,” said Fred, with a mysterious wink. “Come in  here. ...”   He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of  the one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George  inside. George closed the door quietly and then  turned, beaming, to look at Harry.   “Early Christmas present for you, Harry,” he said.   Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a  flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large,  square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing  written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and  George’s jokes, stared at it.   “What’s that supposed to be? “This, Harry, is the secret of our success,” said  George, patting the parchment fondly.   “It’s a wrench, giving it to you,” said Fred, “but we  decided last night, your need’s greater than ours.”   “Anyway, we know it by heart,” said George. “We  bequeath it to you. We don’t really need it anymore.”   “And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?”  said Harry.   “A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes  with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended  him. “Explain, George.”   “Well ... when we were in our first year, Harry —  young, carefree, and innocent — ”   Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George  had ever been innocent.   “ — well, more innocent than we are now — we got  into a spot of bother with Filch.”   “We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset  him for some reason — ”   “So he hauled us off to his office and started  threatening us with the usual — ”   “ — detention — ”   “ — disembowelment — ”   “ — and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of  his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly  Dangerous. “Don’t tell me — ” said Harry, starting to grin.   “Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred. “George  caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I  whipped the drawer open, and grabbed — this.”   “It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know,” said George.  “We don’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it.  He probably suspected what it was, though, or he  wouldn’t have confiscated it.”   “And you know how to work it?”   “Oh yes,” said Fred, smirking. “This little beauty’s  taught us more than all the teachers in this school.”   “You’re winding me up,” said Harry, looking at the  ragged old bit of parchment.   “Oh, are we?” said George.   He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly,  and said, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”   And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a  spider’s web from the point that George’s wand had  touched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed,  they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then  words began to blossom across the top, great, curly  green words, that proclaimed:   Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs   Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers   are proud to present   THE MARAUDER’ It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts  castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing  were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled  with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry  bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner  showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his  study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling  the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was  currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as  Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar  corridors, he noticed something else.   This map showed a set of passages he had never  entered. And many of them seemed to lead —   “Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of  them with his finger. “There are seven in all. Now,  Filch knows about these four” — he pointed them out  — “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know  about these. Don’t bother with the one behind the  mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last  winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And  we don’t reckon anyone’s ever used this one, because  the Whomping Willow’s planted right over the  entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into  the cellar of Honeydukes. We’ve used it loads of times.  And as you might’ve noticed, the entrance is right  outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone’s  hump.”   “Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,” sighed  George, patting the heading of the map. “We owe  them so much.”   “Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new  generation of law-breakers,” said Fred solemnly.   “Right,” said George briskly. “Don’t forget to wipe it  after you’ve used it —  “ — or anyone can read it,” Fred said warningly.   “Just tap it again and say, ‘Mischief managed!’ And  it’ll go blank.”   “So, young Harry,” said Fred, in an uncanny  impersonation of Percy, “mind you behave yourself.”   “See you in Honeydukes,” said George, winking.   They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of  way.   Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He  watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause  to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn’t  know ... he wouldn’t have to pass the dementors at  all. ...   But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement,  something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say  came floating out of his memory.   Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you  can’t see where it keeps its brain.   This map was one of those dangerous magical objects  Mr. Weasley had been warning against. ... Aids for  Magical Mischief-Makers . . . but then, Harry reasoned,  he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it  wasn’t as though he wanted to steal anything or  attack anyone ... and Fred and George had been  using it for years without anything horrible  happening. ...   Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with  his finger Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he  rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and  hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a  couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very  carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the  statue of the one-eyed witch.   What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again  and saw, to his astonishment, that a new ink figure  had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This  figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was  standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.  Harry watched carefully. His little ink self appeared to  be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry  quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue.  Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The  tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure.  The word inside said, “ Dissendium.”   “ Dissendiurrd” Harry whispered, tapping the stone  witch again.   At once, the statue’s hump opened wide enough to  admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up  and down the corridor, then tucked the map away  again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and  pushed himself forward.   He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone  slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up,  looking around. It was pitch dark. He held up his  wand, muttered, “Lumos\\” and saw that he was in a  very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the  map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and  muttered, “Mischief managed!” The map went blank  at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his  robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and  apprehensive, he set off The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow  of a giant rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried  along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor,  holding his wand out in front of him.   It took ages, but Harry had the thought of  Honeydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an  hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry sped  up, his face hot, his feet very cold.   Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn  stone steps, which rose out of sight above him.   Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb.  A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as  he climbed, watching his feet. ... Then, without  warning, his head hit something hard.   It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there,  massaging the top of his head, listening. He couldn’t  hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he pushed  the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.   He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates  and boxes. Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and  replaced it — it blended so perfectly with the dusty  floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry  crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led  upstairs. Now he could definitely hear voices, not to  mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and  shutting of a door.   Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a  door open much closer at hand; somebody was about  to come downstairs.   “And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they’ve  nearly cleaned us out — ” said a woman’s voice A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry  leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the  footsteps to pass. He heard the man shifting boxes  against the opposite wall. He might not get another  chance —   Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his  hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, he  saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head,  buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of  the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself  behind the counter of Honeydukes — he ducked,  crept sideways, and then straightened up.   Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students  that no one looked twice at Harry. He edged among  them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he  imagined the look that would spread over Dudley’s  piggy face if he could see where Harry was now.   There were shelves upon shelves of the most  succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks  of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut ice,  fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds  of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of  Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees,  the levitating sherbert balls that Ron had mentioned;  along yet another wall were “Special Effects” sweets:  Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with  bluebell-colored bubbles that refused to pop for days),  the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny  black Pepper Imps (“breathe fire for your friends!”),   Ice Mice (“hear your teeth chatter and squeak!”),  peppermint creams shaped like toads (“hop  realistically in the stomach!”), fragile sugar-spun  quills, and exploding bonbons.   Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth  years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner o the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and Hermione  were standing underneath it, examining a tray of  blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind  them.   “Ugh, no, Harry won’t want one of those, they’re for  vampires, I expect,” Hermione was saying.   “How about these?” said Ron, shoving ajar of  Cockroach Clusters under Hermione ’s nose.   “Definitely not,” said Harry.   Ron nearly dropped the jar.   “Harry\\” squealed Hermione. “What are you doing  here? How — how did you — ?”   “Wow!” said Ron, looking very impressed, “you’ve  learned to Apparate!”   “ ’Course I haven’t,” said Harry. He dropped his voice  so that none of the sixth years could hear him and  told them all about the Marauder’s Map.   “How come Fred and George never gave it to me!” said  Ron, outraged. “I’m their brother!”   “But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as  though the idea were ludicrous. “He’s going to hand it  in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you, Harry?”   “No, I’m not!” said Harry.   “Are you mad?” said Ron, goggling at Hermione.   “Hand in something that good?”   “If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch  would know Fred and George had nicked it! “But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He  could be using one of the passages on that map to get  into the castle! The teachers have got to know!”   “He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry  quickly. “There are seven secret tunnels on the map,  right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows  about four of them. And of the other three — one of  them’s caved in, so no one can get through it. One of  them’s got the Whomping Willow planted over the  entrance, so you can’t get out of it. And the one I just  came through — well — it’s really hard to see the  entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it  was there ...”   Harry hesitated. What if Black did know the passage  was there? Ron, however, cleared his throat  significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the  inside of the sweetshop door.   — BY ORDER OF —   Customers are reminded that until further notice,  dementors will be patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade  every night after sundown. This measure has been put  in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will  be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is  therefore advisable that you complete your shopping  well before nightfall.   Merry Christmas “See?” said Ron quietly. “I’d like to see Black try and  break into Honeydukes with dementors swarming al over the village. Anyway, Hermione, the Honeydukes  owners would hear a break-in, wouldn’t they? They  live over the shop!”   “Yes, but — but — ” Hermoine seemed to be struggling  to find another problem. “Look, Harry still shouldn’t  be coming into Hogsmeade. He hasn’t got a signed  form! If anyone finds out, he’ll be in so much trouble!  And it’s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns  up today? Now?”   “He’d have a job spotting Harry in this,” said Ron,  nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick,  swirling snow. “Come on, Hermione, it’s Christmas.  Harry deserves a break.”   Hermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.   “Are you going to report me?” Harry asked her,  grinning.   “Oh — of course not — but honestly, Harry — ”   “Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?” said Ron,  grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel.  “And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred gave  me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole  right through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping  him with her broomstick.” Ron stared broodingly into  the Acid Pop box. “Reckon Fred’d take a bit of  Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?”   When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets,  the three of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard  outside.   Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little  thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a  layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on th doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in  the trees.   Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn’t have  his cloak. They headed up the street, heads bowed  against the wind, Ron and Hermione shouting  through their scarves.   “That’s the post office — ”   “Zonko’s is up there — ”   “We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ”   “Tell you what,” said Ron, his teeth chattering, “shall  we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?”   Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and  his hands were freezing, so they crossed the road,  and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn.   It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A  curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a  bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar.   “That’s Madam Rosmerta,” said Ron. “I’ll get the  drinks, shall I?” he added, going slightly red.   Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of  the room, where there was a small, vacant table  between the window and a handsome Christmas tree,  which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five  minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot  butterbeer.   “Merry Christmas!” he said happily, raising his  tankard Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing  he’d ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him  from the inside.   A sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the  Three Broomsticks had opened again. Harry looked  over the rim of his tankard and choked.   Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered  the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed  by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly  man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped  cloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.   In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed  hands on the top of Harry’s head and forced him off  his stool and under the table. Dripping with  butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched  his empty tankard and watched the teachers’ and  Fudge’s feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn  and walk right toward him.   Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered,  “Mobiliarbus\\”   The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few  inches off the ground, drifted sideways, and landed  with a soft thump right in front of their table, hiding  them from view. Staring through the dense lower  branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back  from the table right beside theirs, then heard the  grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they  sat down.   Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly  turquoise high heels, and heard a woman’s voice.   “A small gillywater —  “Mine,” said Professor McGonagall’s voice.   “Four pints of mulled mead — ”   “Ta, Rosmerta,” said Hagrid.   “A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella — ”   “Mmm!” said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.   “So you 11 be the red currant rum, Minister.”   “Thank you, Rosmerta, m’dear,” said Fudge’s voice.  “Lovely to see you again, I must say. Have one  yourself, won’t you? Come and join us. ...”   “Well, thank you very much, Minister.”   Harry watched the glittering heels march away and  back again. His heart was pounding uncomfortably in  his throat. Why hadn’t it occurred to him that this  was the last weekend of term for the teachers too?  And how long were they going to sit there? He needed  time to sneak back into Honeydukes if he wanted to  return to school tonight. ... Hermione’s leg gave a  nervous twitch next to him.   “So, what brings you to this neck of the woods,  Minister?” came Madam Rosmerta’s voice.   Harry saw the lower part of Fudge’s thick body twist  in his chair as though he were checking for  eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet voice, “What  else, m’dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard  what happened up at the school at Halloween?”   “I did hear a rumor,” admitted Madam Rosmerta “Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor  McGonagall exasperatedly.   “Do you think Black’s still in the area, Minister?”  whispered Madam Rosmerta.   “I’m sure of it,” said Fudge shortly.   “You know that the dementors have searched the  whole village twice?” said Madam Rosmerta, a slight  edge to her voice. “Scared all my customers away. ...  It’s very bad for business, Minister.”   “Rosmerta, m’dear, I don’t like them any more than  you do,” said Fudge uncomfortably. “Necessary  precaution ... unfortunate, but there you are. ... I’ve  just met some of them. They’re in a fury against  Dumbledore — he won’t let them inside the castle  grounds.”   “I should think not,” said Professor McGonagall  sharply. “How are we supposed to teach with those  horrors floating around?”   “Hear, hear!” squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose  feet were dangling a foot from the ground.   “All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to  protect you all from something much worse. ... We all  know what Black’s capable of. ...”   “Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,” said  Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. “Of all the people to  go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I’d  have thought ... I mean, I remember him when he was  a boy at Hogwarts. If you’d told me then what he was  going to become, I’d have said you’d had too much  mead. “You don’t know the half of it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge  gruffly. “The worst he did isn’t widely known.”   “The worst?” said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive  with curiosity. “Worse than murdering all those poor  people, you mean?”   “I certainly do,” said Fudge.   “I can’t believe that. What could possibly be worse?”   “You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,”  murmured Professor McGonagall. “Do you remember  who his best friend was?”   “Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small  laugh. “Never saw one without the other, did you? The  number of times I had them in here — ooh, they used  to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black  and James Potter!”   Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron  kicked him.   “Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and  Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very  bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact — but  I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of  troublemakers — ”   “I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George  Weasley could give ’em a run fer their money.”   “You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!”  chimed in Professor Flitwick. “Inseparable!”   “Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted  Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed  when they left school. Black was best man whe James married Lily. Then they named him godfather  to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can  imagine how the idea would torment him.”   “Because Black turned out to be in league with You-  Know-Who?” whispered Madam Rosmerta.   “Worse even than that, m’dear. ...” Fudge dropped his  voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. “Not  many people are aware that the Potters knew You-  Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of  course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had  a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off,  and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised  them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-  Who wasn’t an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore  told them that their best chance was the Fidelius  Charm.”   “How does that work?” said Madam Rosmerta,  breathless with interest. Professor Flitwick cleared his  throat.   “An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily,  “involving the magical concealment of a secret inside  a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside  the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is  henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the  Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the  Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could  search the village where Lily and James were staying  for years and never find them, not even if he had his  nose pressed against their sitting room window!”   “So Black was the Potters’ Secret-Keeper?” whispered  Madam Rosmerta.   “Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “James Potter  told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tel where they were, that Black was planning to go into  hiding himself . . . and yet, Dumbledore remained  worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters’  Secret-Keeper himself.”   “He suspected Black?” gasped Madam Rosmerta.   “He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had  been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their  movements,” said Professor McGonagall darkly.  “Indeed, he had suspected for some time that  someone on our side had turned traitor and was  passing a lot of information to You-Know-Who.”   “But James Potter insisted on using Black?”   “He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week  after the Fidelius Charm had been performed — ”   “Black betrayed them?” breathed Madam Rosmerta.   “He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent  role, he was ready to declare his support openly for  You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this  for the moment of the Potters’ death. But, as we all  know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry  Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled. And  this left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His  master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black,  had shown his true colors as a traitor. He had no  choice but to run for it — ”   “Filthy, stinkin’ turncoat!” Hagrid said, so loudly that  half the bar went quiet.   “Shh!” said Professor McGonagall.   “I met him!” growled Hagrid. “I musta bin the last ter  see him before he killed all them people! It was m what rescued Harry from Lily an’ James’s house after  they was killed! Jus’ got him outta the ruins, poor  little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an’  his parents dead ... an’ Sirius Black turns up, on that  flyin’ motorbike he used ter ride. Never occurred ter  me what he was doin’ there. I didn’ know he’d bin Lily  an’ James’s Secret-Keeper. Thought he’d jus’ heard  the news o’ You- Know- Who’s attack an’ come ter see  what he could do. White an’ shakin’, he was. An’ yeh  know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN’  TRAITOR!” Hagrid roared.   “Hagrid, please!” said Professor McGonagall. “Keep  your voice down!”   “How was I ter know he wasn’ upset abou’ Lily an’  James? It was You-Know-Who he cared abou’! An’  then he says, ‘Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I’m his  godfather, I’ll look after him — ’ Ha! But I’d had me  orders from Dumbledore, an’ I told Black no,  Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an’  uncle’s. Black argued, but in the end he gave in. Told  me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. ‘I won’t  need it anymore,’ he says.   “I shoulda known there was somethin’ fishy goin’ on  then. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin’ it  ter me for? Why wouldn’ he need it anymore? Fact  was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he’d  bin the Potters’ Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was  goin’ ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a  matter o’ hours before the Ministry was after him.   “But what if I’d given Harry to him, eh? I bet he ’d’ve  pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes’  friends’ son! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark  Side, there’s nothin’ and no one that matters to ’em  anymore. ... A long silence followed Hagrid ’s story. Then Madam  Rosmerta said with some satisfaction, “But he didn’t  manage to disappear, did he? The Ministry of Magic  caught up with him next day!”   “Alas, if only we had,” said Fudge bitterly. “It was not  we who found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew —  another of the Potters’ friends. Maddened by grief, no  doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters’  Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.”   “Pettigrew . . . that fat little boy who was always  tagging around after them at Hogwarts?” said Madam  Rosmerta.   “Hero-worshipped Black and Potter,” said Professor  McGonagall. “Never quite in their league, talent-wise.   I was often rather sharp with him. You can imagine  how I — how I regret that now. ...” She sounded as  though she had a sudden head cold.   “There, now, Minerva,” said Fudge kindly, “Pettigrew  died a hero’s death. Eyewitnesses — Muggles, of  course, we wiped their memories later — told us how  Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing,  “Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?’ And then he  went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker.  Blew Pettigrew to smithereens. ...”   Professor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly,  “Stupid boy . . . foolish boy ... he was always hopeless  at dueling ... should have left it to the Ministry. ...”   “I tell yeh, if I’d got ter Black before little Pettigrew  did, I wouldn’t’ve messed around with wands — I’d’ve  ripped him limb — from — limb,” Hagrid growled.   “You don’t know what you’re talking about, Hagrid,”  said Fudge sharply. “Nobody but trained Hit Wizard from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have  stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I  was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical  Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on  the scene after Black murdered all those people. I — I  will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A  crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had  cracked the sewer below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles  screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with  what was left of Pettigrew in front of him ... a heap of  bloodstained robes and a few — a few fragments — ”   Fudge’s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound  of five noses being blown.   “Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge  thickly. “Black was taken away by twenty members of  the Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Pettigrew  received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I  think was some comfort to his poor mother. Black’s  been in Azkaban ever since.”   Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.   “Is it true he’s mad, Minister?”   “I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly. “I  certainly believe his master’s defeat unhinged him for  a while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those  Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate  man — cruel ... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last  inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the  prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the  dark; there’s no sense in them ... but I was shocked  at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite  rationally to me. It was unnerving. You’d have  thought he was merely bored — asked if I’d finished  with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he  missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded a how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on  him — and he was one of the most heavily guarded in  the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day  and night.”   “But what do you think he’s broken out to do?” said  Madam Rosmerta. “Good gracious, Minister, he isn’t  trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?”   “I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan,” said  Fudge evasively. “But we hope to catch Black long  before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and  friendless is one thing . . . but give him back his most  devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly  he’ll rise again. ...”   There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone  had set down their glass.   “You know, Cornelius, if you’re dining with the  headmaster, we’d better head back up to the castle,”  said Professor McGonagall.   One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the  weight of their owners once more; hems of cloaks  swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta’s glittering  heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the  Three Broomsticks opened again, there was another  flurry of snow, and the teachers had disappeared.   “Harry?”   Ron’s and Hermione’s faces appeared under the table.  They were both staring at him, lost for words Harry didn’t have a very clear idea of how he had  managed to get back into the Honeydukes cellar,  through the tunnel, and into the castle once more. All  he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no  time at all, and that he hardly noticed what he was  doing, because his head was still pounding with the  conversation he had just heard.   Why had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid,  Mr. Weasley, Cornelius Fudge ... why hadn’t anyone  ever mentioned the fact that Harry’s parents had died  because their best friend had betrayed them?   Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all  through dinner, not daring to talk about what they’d  overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them.  When they went upstairs to the crowded common  room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a  dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end-of-term high spirits.  Harry, who didn’t want Fred and George asking him  whether he’d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked  quietly up to the empty dormitory and heade straight for his bedside cabinet. He pushed his books  aside and quickly found what he was looking for —  the leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him  two years ago, which was full of wizard pictures of his  mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the  hangings around him, and started turning the pages,  searching, until ...   He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day.  There was his father waving up at him, beaming, the  untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in  all directions. There was his mother, alight with  happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there ...  that must be him. Their best man ... Harry had never  given him a thought before.   If he hadn’t known it was the same person, he would  never have guessed it was Black in this old  photograph. His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but  handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been  working for Voldemort when this picture had been  taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the two  people next to him? Did he realize he was facing  twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would  make him unrecognizable?   But the dementors don’t affect him, Harry thought,  staring into the handsome, laughing face. He doesn’t  have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close —   Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and  stuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his robe and  glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings  were hiding him from view.   The dormitory door opened.   “Harry?” said Ron’s voice uncertainly But Harry lay still, pretending to be asleep. He heard  Ron leave again, and rolled over on his back, his eyes  wide open.   A hatred such as he had never known before was  coursing through Harry like poison. He could see  Black laughing at him through the darkness, as  though somebody had pasted the picture from the  album over his eyes. He watched, as though  somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius  Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville  Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. He could hear  (though having no idea what Black’s voice might  sound like) a low, excited mutter. “It has happened,  My Lord . . . the Potters have made me their Secret-  Keeper. ...” And then came another voice, laughing  shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his  head whenever the dementors drew near. . . .   “Harry, you — you look terrible.”   Harry hadn’t gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had  awoken to find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and  gone down the spiral staircase to a common room  that was completely empty except for Ron, who was  eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his  stomach, and Hermione, who had spread her  homework over three tables.   “Where is everyone?” said Harry.   “Gone! It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?”  said Ron, watching Harry closely. “It’s nearly  lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a  minute.”   Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was  still falling outside the windows. Crookshanks was  spread out in front of the fire like a large, ginger rug “You really don’t look well, you know,” Hermione said,  peering anxiously into his face.   “I’m fine,” said Harry.   “Harry, listen,” said Hermione, exchanging a look with  Ron, “you must be really upset about what we heard  yesterday. But the thing is, you mustn’t go doing  anything stupid.”   “Like what?” said Harry.   “Like trying to go after Black,” said Ron sharply.   Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation  while he had been asleep. He didn’t say anything.   “You won’t, will you, Harry?” said Hermione.   “Because Black’s not worth dying for,” said Ron.   Harry looked at them. They didn’t seem to  understand at all.   “D’you know what I see and hear every time a  dementor gets too near me?” Ron and Hermione  shook their heads, looking apprehensive. “I can hear  my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort.   And if you’d heard your mum screaming like that,  just about to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it in a  hurry. And if you found out someone who was  supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent  Voldemort after her — ”   “There’s nothing you can do!” said Hermione, looking  stricken. “The dementors will catch Black and he’ll go  back to Azkaban and — and serve him right! “You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t affected by  Azkaban like normal people are. It’s not a  punishment for him like it is for the others.”   “So what are you saying?” said Ron, looking very  tense. “You want to — to kill Black or something?”   “Don’t be silly,” said Hermione in a panicky voice.  “Harry doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?”   Again, Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t know what he  wanted to do. All he knew was that the idea of doing  nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more  than he could stand.   “Malfoy knows,” he said abruptly. “Remember what  he said to me in Potions? ‘If it was me, I’d hunt him  down myself. ... I’d want revenge.’ ”   “You’re going to take Malfoy ’s advice instead of ours?”  said Ron furiously. “Listen ... you know what  Pettigrew’s mother got back after Black had finished  with him? Dad told me — the Order of Merlin, First  Class, and Pettigrew’s finger in a box. That was the  biggest bit of him they could find. Black’s a madman,  Harry, and he’s dangerous — ”   “Malfoy’s dad must have told him,” said Harry,  ignoring Ron. “He was right in Voldemort’s inner  circle — ”   “ Say You-Knotu-Who, will you?” interjected Ron  angrily.   “ — so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working  for Voldemort — ”   “ — and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a  million pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy’s jus hoping you 11 get yourself killed before he has to play  you at Quidditch.”   “Harry, please,” said Hermione, her eyes now shining  with tears, “please be sensible. Black did a terrible,  terrible thing, but d-don’t put yourself in danger, it’s  what Black wants. ... Oh, Harry, you’d be playing  right into Black’s hands if you went looking for him.  Your mum and dad wouldn’t want you to get hurt,  would they? They’d never want you to go looking for  Black!”   “I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because  thanks to Black, I’ve never spoken to them,” said  Harry shortly.   There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched  luxuriously, flexing his claws. Ron’s pocket quivered.   “Look,” said Ron, obviously casting around for a  change of subject, “it’s the holidays! It’s nearly  Christmas! Let’s — let’s go down and see Hagrid. We  haven’t visited him for ages!”   “No!” said Hermione quickly. “Harry isn’t supposed to  leave the castle, Ron — ”   “Yeah, let’s go,” said Harry, sitting up, “and I can ask  him how come he never mentioned Black when he  told me all about my parents!”   Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn’t  what Ron had had in mind.   “Or we could have a game of chess,” he said hastily,  “or Gobstones. Percy left a set — ”   “No, let’s visit Hagrid,” said Harry firmly So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set  off through the portrait hole (“Stand and fight, you  yellow-bellied mongrels!”), down through the empty  castle and out through the oak front doors.   They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a  shallow trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their  socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and  freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it  had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver,  and Hagrid’s cabin looked like an iced cake.   Ron knocked, but there was no answer.   “He’s not out, is he?” said Hermione, who was  shivering under her cloak.   Ron had his ear to the door.   “There’s a weird noise,” he said. “Listen — is that  Fang?”   Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too.  From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing  moans.   “Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron  nervously.   “Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door. “Hagrid,  are you in there?”   There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door  creaked open. Hagrid stood there with his eyes red  and swollen, tears splashing down the front of his  leather vest.   “Yeh’ve heard?” he bellowed, and he flung himself  onto Harry’s neck Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man,  this was no laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse  under Hagrid’s weight, was rescued by Ron and  Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and  heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed  himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over  the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with  tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.   “Hagrid, what is it?” said Hermione, aghast.   Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on  the table.   “What’s this, Hagrid?”   Hagrid’s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter  toward Harry, who picked it up and read aloud:   Dear Mr. Hagrid,   Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on  a student in your class, we have accepted the  assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no  responsibility for the regrettable incident.   “Well, that’s okay then, Hagrid!” said Ron, clapping  Hagrid on the shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob,  and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to  read on.   However, we must register our concern about the  hippogriff in question. We have decided to uphold the  official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter  will therefore be taken to the Committee for the  Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take  place on April 20th, and we ask you to present  yourself and your hippogriff at the Committee’s office in London on that date. In the meantime, the hippogriff  should be kept tethered and isolated.   Yours in fellowship ...   There followed a list of the school governors.   “Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad  hippogriff, Hagrid. I bet he’ll get off — ”   “Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer  the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures!” choked Hagrid,  wiping his eyes on his sleeve. “They’ve got it in fer  interestin’ creatures!”   A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid ’s cabin  made Harry, Ron, and Hermione whip around.  Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,  chomping on something that was oozing blood all over  the floor.   “I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!”  choked Hagrid. “All on his own! At Christmas.”   Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.   They had never seen eye to eye with Hagrid about  what he called “interesting creatures” and other  people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other  hand, there didn’t seem to be any particular harm in  Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he  was positively cute.   “You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,”  said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on  Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you can prove  Buckbeak is safe. “Won’t make no difference!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them  Disposal devils, they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket!  Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case, Buckbeak — ”   Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then  gave a great wail and lurched forward, his face in his  arms.   “What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?” said Harry.   “He’s done more’n enough fer me already,” groaned  Hagrid. “Got enough on his plate what with keepin’  them dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black  lurkin’ around — ”   Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though  expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling  him the truth about Black. But Harry couldn’t bring  himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so  miserable and scared.   “Listen, Hagrid,” he said, “you can’t give up.  Hermione’s right, you just need a good defense. You  can call us as witnesses — ”   “I’m sure I’ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,”  said Hermione thoughtfully, “where the hippogriff got  off. I’ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what  happened.”   Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione  looked at Ron to help them.   “Er — shall I make a cup of tea?” said Ron.   Harry stared at him.   “It’s what my mum does whenever someone’s upset,”  Ron muttered, shrugging At last, after many more assurances of help, with a  steaming mug of tea in front of him, Hagrid blew his  nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and  said, “Yer right. I can’ afford to go ter pieces. Gotta  pull meself together. ...”   Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the  table and laid his head on Hagrid ’s knee.   “I’ve not bin meself lately,” said Hagrid, stroking Fang  with one hand and mopping his face with the other.  “Worried abou’ Buckbeak, an’ no one likin’ me classe “We do like them!” lied Hermione at once.   “Yeah, they’re great!” said Ron, crossing his fingers  under the table. “Er — how are the flobberworms?”   “Dead,” said Hagrid gloomily. “Too much lettuce.”   “Oh no!” said Ron, his lip twitching.   “An’ them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an’  all,” said Hagrid, with a sudden shudder. “Gotta walk  past ’em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three  Broomsticks. ’S like bein’ back in Azkaban — ”   He fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and  Hermione watched him breathlessly. They had never  heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban  before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, “Is it  awful in there, Hagrid?”   “Yeh’ve no idea,” said Hagrid quietly. “Never bin  anywhere like it. Thought I was goin’ mad. Kep’ goin’  over horrible stuff in me mind . . . the day I got  expelled from Hogwarts . . . day me dad died . . . day I  had ter let Norbert go. ... His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby  dragon Hagrid had once won in a game of cards “Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while.  An’ yeh can’ see the point o’ livin’ at all. I used ter  hope I’d jus’ die in me sleep. ... When they let me out,  it was like bein’ born again, ev’rythin’ came floodin’  back, it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world. Mind, the  dementors weren’t keen on lettin’ me go.”   “But you were innocent!” said Hermione.   Hagrid snorted.   “Think that matters to them? They don’ care. Long as  they’ve got a couple o’ hundred humans stuck there  with ’em, so they can leech all the happiness out of  ’em, they don’ give a damn who’s guilty an’ who’s  not.”   Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea.  Then he said quietly, “Thought o’ jus’ letting  Buckbeak go ... tryin’ ter make him fly away ... but  how d’yeh explain ter a hippogriff it’s gotta go inter  hidin’? An’ — an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law. ...” He  looked up at them, tears leaking down his face again.  “I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.”   The trip to Hagrid’s, though far from fun, had  nevertheless had the effect Ron and Hermione had  hoped. Though Harry had by no means forgotten  about Black, he couldn’t brood constantly on revenge  if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the  Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.  He, Ron, and Hermione went to the library the next  day and returned to the empty common room laden  with books that might help prepare a defense for  Buckbeak. The three of them sat in front of the  roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dust volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts,  speaking occasionally when they ran across  something relevant.   “Here’s something ... there was a case in 1722 ... but  the hippogriff was convicted — ugh, look what they  did to it, that’s disgusting — ”   “This might help, look — a manticore savaged  someone in 1296, and they let the manticore off — oh  — no, that was only because everyone was too scared  to go near it. ...”   Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual  magnificent Christmas decorations had been put up,  despite the fact that hardly any of the students  remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and  mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious  lights shone from inside every suit of armor, and the  Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve Christmas  trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and  delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and  by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even  Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron’s  pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.   On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron  throwing his pillow at him.   “Oy! Presents!”   Harry reached for his glasses and put them on,  squinting through the semi-darkness to the foot of his  bed, where a small heap of parcels had appeared. Ron  was already ripping the paper off his own presents.   “Another sweater from Mum . . . maroon again . . . see if  you’ve got one. Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet  sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front,  also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas  cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these  things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying  underneath.   “What’s that?” said Ron, looking over, a freshly  unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.   “Dunno ...”   Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a  magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his  bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and jumped off his  bed for a closer look.   “I don’t believe it,” he said hoarsely.   It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry  had gone to see every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle  glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating  and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly  the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved  from the golden registration number at the top of the  handle, right down to the perfectly smooth,  streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.   “Who sent it to you?” said Ron in a hushed voice.   “Look and see if there’s a card,” said Harry.   Ron ripped apart the Firebolt’s wrappings.   “Nothing! Blimey, who’d spend that much on you?”   “Well,” said Harry, feeling stunned, “I’m betting it  wasn’t the Dursleys. “I bet it was Dumbledore,” said Ron, now walking  around and around the Firebolt, taking in every  glorious inch. “He sent you the Invisibility Cloak  anonymously. ...”   “That was my dad’s, though,” said Harry.  “Dumbledore was just passing it on to me. He  wouldn’t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can’t  go giving students stuff like this — ”   “That’s why he wouldn’t say it was from him!” said  Ron. “In case some git like Malfoy said it was  favoritism. Hey, Harry” — Ron gave a great whoop of  laughter — “Malfoyl Wait till he sees you on this! He’ll  be sick as a pig! This is an international standard  broom, this is!”   “I can’t believe this,” Harry muttered, running a hand  along the Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry’s bed,  laughing his head off at the thought of Malfoy. “ Who  — ?”   “I know,” said Ron, controlling himself, “I know who it  could’ve been — Lupin!”   “What?” said Harry, now starting to laugh himself.  “Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he’d be able  to buy himself some new robes.”   “Yeah, but he likes you,” said Ron. “And he was away  when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might’ve  heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and  get this for you — ”   “What d’you mean, he was away?” said Harry. “He  was ill when I was playing in that match. “Well, he wasn’t in the hospital wing,” said Ron. “I  was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention  from Snape, remember?”   Harry frowned at Ron.   “I can’t see Lupin affording something like this.”   “What ’re you two laughing about?”   Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing  gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking  very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his  neck.   “Don’t bring him in here!” said Ron, hurriedly  snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and  stowing him in his pajama pocket. But Hermione  wasn’t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto  Seamus’s empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at  the Firebolt.   “Oh, Harry\\ Who sent you that?”   “No idea,” said Harry. “There wasn’t a card or  anything with it.”   To his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either  excited or intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her  face fell, and she bit her lip.   “What’s the matter with you?” said Ron.   “I don’t know,” said Hermione slowly, “but it’s a bit  odd, isn’t it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a  good broom, isn’t it?”   Ron sighed exasperatedly “It’s the best broom there is, Hermione,” he said.   “So it must’ve been really expensive. ...”   “Probably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms  put together,” said Ron happily.   “Well ... who’d send Harry something as expensive as  that, and not even tell him they’d sent it?” said  Hermione.   “Who cares?” said Ron impatiently. “Listen, Harry,  can I have a go on it? Can I?”   “I don’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!”  said Hermione shrilly.   Harry and Ron looked at her.   “What d’you think Harry’s going to do with it — sweep  the floor?” said Ron.   But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks  sprang from Seamus’s bed, right at Ron’s chest.   “GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE!” Ron bellowed  as Crookshanks ’s claws ripped his pajamas and  Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder.  Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a  misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at  the end of Harry’s bed, knocking it over and causing  Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.   Crookshanks ’s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill,  tinny whistling was filling the room. The Pocket  Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle  Vernon’s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on  the floor “I forgot about that!” Harry said, bending down and  picking up the Sneakoscope. “I never wear those  socks if I can help it. ...”   The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm.  Crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it.   “You’d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,”  said Ron furiously, sitting on Harry’s bed nursing his  toe. “Can’t you shut that thing up?” he added to  Harry as Hermione strode out of the room,  Crookshanks ’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on  Ron.   Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks  and threw it back into his trunk. All that could be  heard now were Ron’s stifled moans of pain and rage.  Scabbers was huddled in Ron’s hands. It had been a  while since Harry had seen him out of Ron’s pocket,  and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that  Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny; patches  of fur seemed to have fallen out too.   “He’s not looking too good, is he?” Harry said.   “It’s stress!” said Ron. “He’d be fine if that big stupid  furball left him alone!”   But Harry, remembering what the woman at the  Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only  three years, couldn’t help feeling that unless Scabbers  had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching  the end of his life. And despite Ron’s frequent  complaints that Scabbers was both boring and  useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if  Scabbers died.   Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in  the Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermion had shut Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was  furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was still  fuming about Crookshanks ’s fresh attempt to eat  Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to  each other and devoted himself to examining the  Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common  room with him. For some reason this seemed to  annoy Hermione as well; she didn’t say anything, but  she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too  had been criticizing her cat.   At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to  find that the House tables had been moved against  the walls again, and that a single table, set for twelve,  stood in the middle of the room. Professors  Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and  Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker,  who had taken off his usual brown coat and was  wearing a very old and rather moldy-looking tailcoat.  There were only three other students, two extremely  nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced  Slytherin fifth year.   “Merry Christmas!” said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron,  and Hermione approached the table. “As there are so  few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables.   ... Sit down, sit down!”   Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at  the end of the table.   “Crackers!” said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering  the end of a large silver noisemaker to Snape, who  took it reluctantly and tugged. With a bang like a  gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,  pointed witch’s hat topped with a stuffed vulture.   Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron’s eye  and they both grinned; Snape ’s mouth thinned an he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped  it for his wizard’s hat at once “Dig in!” he advised the table, beaming around.   As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the  doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Professor  Trelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels.  She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of  the occasion, making her look more than ever like a  glittering, oversized dragonfly.   “Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!” said Dumbledore,  standing up.   “I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,” said  Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway  voice, “and to my astonishment, I saw myself  abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join  you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at  once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to  forgive my lateness. ...”   “Certainly, certainly,” said Dumbledore, his eyes  twinkling. “Let me draw you up a chair — ”   And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his  wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling  with a thud between Professors Snape and  McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit  down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the  table, and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream.   “I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be  thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget  that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will  be the first to die! “Well risk it, Sibyll,” said Professor McGonagall  impatiently. “Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone  cold. Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself  into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched  tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the  table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into  the nearest tureen.   “Tripe, Sibyll?”   Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again,  she looked around once more and said, “But where is  dear Professor Lupin?”   “I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,” said  Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start  serving themselves. “Most unfortunate that it should  happen on Christmas Day.”   “But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?” said  Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised.   Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very  cold look.   “Certainly I knew, Minerva,” she said quietly. “But  one does not parade the fact that one is All-Knowing.   I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the  Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.”   “That explains a great deal,” said Professor  McGonagall tartly.   Professor Trelawney’s voice suddenly became a good  deal less misty “If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor  Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He  seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He  positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him  “Imagine that,” said Professor McGonagall dryly.   “I doubt,” said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly  raised voice, which put an end to Professor  McGonagall and Professor Trelawney’s conversation,  “that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger.  Severus, you’ve made the potion for him again?”   “Yes, Headmaster,” said Snape.   “Good,” said Dumbledore. “Then he should be up and  about in no time. ... Derek, have you had any of these  chipolatas? They’re excellent.”   The first-year boy went furiously red on being  addressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the  platter of sausages with trembling hands.   Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until  the very end of Christmas dinner, two hours later.   Full to bursting with Christmas dinner and still  wearing their party hats, Harry and Ron got up first  from the table and she shrieked loudly.   “My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?”   “Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry.   “I doubt it will make much difference,” said Professor  McGonagall coldly, “unless a mad axe-man is waiting  outside the doors to slaughter the first into the  entrance hall. Even Ron laughed. Professor Trelawney looked highly  affronted.   “Coming?” Harry said to Hermione.   “No,” Hermione muttered, “I want a quick word with  Professor McGonagall.”   “Probably trying to see if she can take any more  classes,” yawned Ron as they made their way into the  entrance hall, which was completely devoid of mad  axe-men.   When they reached the portrait hole, they found Sir  Cadogan enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of  monks, several previous headmasters of Hogwarts,  and his fat pony. He pushed up his visor and toasted  them with a flagon of mead.   “Merry — hie — Christmas! Password?”   “Scurvy cur,” said Ron.   “And the same to you, sir!” roared Sir Cadogan as the  painting swung forward to admit them.   Harry went straight up to the dormitory, collected the  Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione  had given him for his birthday, brought them  downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the  Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip,  and the handle was so shiny already it seemed  pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring  it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and  Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor  McGonagall.   Though Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor  House, Harry had seen her in the common room onl once before, and that had been to make a very grave  announcement. He and Ron stared at her, both  holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around them,  sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid her  face behind it.   “So that’s it, is it?” said Professor McGonagall beadily,  walking over to the fireside and staring at the  Firebolt. “Miss Granger has just informed me that you  have been sent a broomstick, Potter.”   Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They  could see her forehead reddening over the top of her  book, which was upside down.   “May I?” said Professor McGonagall, but she didn’t  wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of  their hands. She examined it carefully from handle to  twig-ends. “Hmm. And there was no note at all,   Potter? No card? No message of any kind?”   “No,” said Harry blankly.   “I see ... ,” said Professor McGonagall. “Well, I’m  afraid I will have to take this, Potter.”   “W — what?” said Harry, scrambling to his feet.  “Why?”   “It will need to be checked for jinxes,” said Professor  McGonagall. “Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay  Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it  down — ”   “Strip it down?” repeated Ron, as though Professor  McGonagall was mad “It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks,” said  Professor McGonagall. “You will have it back if we are  sure it is jinx-free.”   “There’s nothing wrong with it!” said Harry, his voice  shaking slightly. “Honestly, Professor — ”   “You can’t know that, Potter,” said Professor  McGonagall, quite kindly, “not until you’ve flown it, at  any rate, and I’m afraid that is out of the question  until we are certain that it has not been tampered  with. I shall keep you informed.”   Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried  the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed  behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of  High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron,  however, rounded on Hermione.   “What did you go running to McGonagall for?”   Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in  the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly.   “Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall  agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent  to Harry by Sirius Black! Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that  didn’t stop him from being angry with her. He had  been the owner of the best broom in the world for a  few short hours, and now, because of her  interference, he didn’t know whether he would ever  see it again. He was positive that there was nothing  wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state  would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts  of anti-jinx tests?   Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was  concerned, the stripping-down of a brand-new  Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage.  Hermione, who remained convinced that she had  acted for the best, started avoiding the common room.  Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the  library and didn’t try to persuade her to come back.  All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school  returned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower  became crowded and noisy again Wood sought Harry out on the night before term  started “Had a good Christmas?” he said, and then, without  waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered his voice,  and said, “I’ve been doing some thinking over  Christmas, Harry. After the last match, you know. If  the dementors come to the next one ... I mean . . . we  can’t afford you to — well — ”   Wood broke off, looking awkward.   “I’m working on it,” said Harry quickly. “Professor  Lupin said he’d train me to ward off the dementors.  We should be starting this week. He said he’d have  time after Christmas.”   “Ah,” said Wood, his expression clearing. “Well, in  that case — I really didn’t want to lose you as Seeker,  Harry. And have you ordered a new broom yet?”   “No,” said Harry.   “What! You’d better get a move on, you know — you  can’t ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!”   “He got a Firebolt for Christmas,” said Ron.   “A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A — a real Firebolt?”   “Don’t get excited, Oliver,” said Harry gloomily. “I  haven’t got it anymore. It was confiscated.” And he  explained all about how the Firebolt was now being  checked for jinxes.   “Jinxed? How could it be jinxed? “Sirius Black,” Harry said wearily. “He’s supposed to  be after me. So McGonagall reckons he might have  sent it.”   Waving aside the information that a famous murderer  was after his Seeker, Wood said, “But Black couldn’t  have bought a Firebolt! He’s on the run! The whole  country’s on the lookout for him! How could he just  walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a  broomstick?”   “I know,” said Harry, “but McGonagall still wants to  strip it down — ”   Wood went pale.   “I’ll go and talk to her, Harry,” he promised. “I’ll make  her see reason. ... A Firebolt ... a real Firebolt, on our  team . . . She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we  do. ... I’ll make her see sense. A Firebolt ...”   Classes started again the next day. The last thing  anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the  grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had  provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their  enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson  collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing  while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and  down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first  Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun;  Professor Trelawney was now teaching them  palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry  that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.   It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was  keen to get to; after his conversation with Wood, he  wanted to get started on his anti-dementor lessons as  soon as possible “Ah yes,” said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his  promise at the end of class. “Let me see ... how about  eight o’clock on Thursday evening? The History of  Magic classroom should be large enough. ... I’ll have  to think carefully about how we’re going to do this. ...  We can’t bring a real dementor into the castle to  practice on. ...”   “Still looks ill, doesn’t he?” said Ron as they walked  down the corridor, heading to dinner. “What d’you  reckon ’s the matter with him?”   There was a loud and impatient “tuh” from behind  them. It was Hermione, who had been sitting at the  feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was  so full of books it wouldn’t close.   “And what are you tutting at us for?” said Ron  irritably.   “Nothing,” said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her  bag back over her shoulder.   “Yes, you were,” said Ron. “I said I wonder what’s  wrong with Lupin, and you — ”   “Well, isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, with a look of  maddening superiority.   “If you don’t want to tell us, don’t,” snapped Ron.   “Fine,” said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.   “She doesn’t know,” said Ron, staring resentfully after  Hermione. “She’s just trying to get us to talk to her  again.”   At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Harry left  Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom It was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the  lamps with his wand and had waited only five  minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a  large packing case, which he heaved onto Professor  Binns’ desk.   “What’s that?” said Harry.   “Another boggart,” said Lupin, stripping off his cloak.  “I’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and  very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s  filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real  dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when  he sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him. I can  store him in my office when we’re not using him;  there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”   “Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he  wasn’t apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin  had found such a good substitute for a real dementor.   “So ...” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand,  and indicated that Harry should do the same. “The  spell I am going to try and teach you is highly  advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary  Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.”   “How does it work?” said Harry nervously.   “Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a  Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-  dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between  you and the dementor.”   Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching  behind a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club.  Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a kind of  positive force, a projection of the very things that the  dementor feeds upon — hope, happiness, the desir to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as real  humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I  must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too  advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have  difficulty with it.”   “What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry  curiously.   “Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”  “And how do you conjure it?”   “With an incantation, which will work only if you are  concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very  happy memory.”   Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory.  Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the  Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on the  moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.   “Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible  the wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach.   “The incantation is this — ” Lupin cleared his throat.  “Expecto patronum).”   “Expecto patronum,” Harry repeated under his breath,  “expecto patronum.”   “Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”   “Oh — yeah — ” said Harry, quickly forcing his  thoughts back to that first broom ride. “Expecto  patrono — no, patronum — sorry — expecto patronum,  expecto patronum —  Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his  wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas “Did you see that?” said Harry excitedly. “Something  happened!”   “Very good,” said Lupin, smiling. “Right, then — ready  to try it on a dementor?”   “Yes,” Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and  moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He  tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else  kept intruding. . . . Any second now, he might hear his  mother again . . . but he shouldn’t think that, or he  would hear her again, and he didn’t want to ... or did  he?   Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.   A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face  turned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand  gripping its cloak. The lamps around the classroom  flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from  the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry,  drawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing  cold broke over him —   “Expecto patronurrd” Harry yelled. “Expecto patronum).  Expecto — ”   But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.   . . . Harry was falling again through thick white fog,  and his mother’s voice was louder than ever, echoing  inside his head — “ Not Harry\\ Not Harry\\ Please — I’ll  do anything — ”   “Stand aside. Stand aside, girl\\”   “Harry! Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back  on the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again.  He didn’t have to ask what had happened.   “Sorry,” he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat  trickling down behind his glasses.   “Are you all right?” said Lupin.   “Yes ...” Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks  and leaned against it.   “Here — ” Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. “Eat  this before we try again. I didn’t expect you to do it  your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if  you had.”   “It’s getting worse,” Harry muttered, biting off the  Frog’s head. “I could hear her louder that time — and  him — Voldemort — ”   Lupin looked paler than usual.   “Harry, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than  understand — ”   “I do!” said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the  Chocolate Frog into his mouth. “I’ve got to! What if  the dementors turn up at our match against  Ravenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we lose  this game we’ve lost the Quidditch Cup!”   “All right then ... ,” said Lupin. “You might want to  select another memory, a happy memory, I mean, to  concentrate on. ... That one doesn’t seem to have  been strong enough. ...”   Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when  Gryffindor had won the House Championship las year had definitely qualified as very happy. He  gripped his wand tightly again and took up his  position in the middle of the classroom.   “Ready?” said Lupin, gripping the box lid.   “Ready,” said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with  happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not  dark thoughts about what was going to happen when  the box opened.   “Go!” said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went  icily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided  forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was  extending toward Harry —   “Expecto patronum).” Harry yelled. “Expecto patronuml  Expecto pat — ”   White fog obscured his senses . . . big, blurred shapes  were moving around him ... then came a new voice, a  man’s voice, shouting, panicking —   “Lily, take Harry and go\\ It’s him\\ Go! Run\\ I’ll hold him   off~   The sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a  door bursting open — a cackle of high-pitched  laughter —   “Harry! Harry ... wake up. ...”   Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time  it was a minute before Harry understood why he was  lying on a dusty classroom floor.   “I heard my dad,” Harry mumbled. “That’s the first  time I’ve ever heard him — he tried to take o Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his  face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low  as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending  to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn’t see.   “You heard James?” said Lupin in a strange voice.   “Yeah ...” Face dry, Harry looked up. “Why — you  didn’t know my dad, did you?”   “I — I did, as a matter of fact,” said Lupin. “We were  friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry — perhaps we  should leave it here for tonight. This charm is  ridiculously advanced. ... I shouldn’t have suggested  putting you through this. ...”   “No!” said Harry. He got up again. “I’ll have one more  go! I’m not thinking of happy enough things, that’s  what it is. ... Hang on. ...”   He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory  . . . one that he could turn into a good, strong  Patronus ...   The moment when he’d first found out he was a  wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for  Hogwarts! If that wasn’t a happy memory, he didn’t  know what was. ... Concentrating very hard on how  he had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet  Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case  once more.   “Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were  doing this against his better judgment.   “Concentrating hard? All right — go! He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and  the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and  dark —   “EXPECTO PATRONUM ” Harry bellowed. “ EXPECTO  PATRONUM EXPECTO PATRONUM ”   The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again  — except this time, it sounded as though it were  coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and louder  and softer again — and he could still see the  dementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver  shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry’s wand,  to hover between him and the dementor, and though  Harry’s legs felt like water, he was still on his feet —  though for how much longer, he wasn’t sure —   “ RiddikulusV’ roared Lupin, springing forward.   There was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus  vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a  chair, feeling as exhausted as if he’d just run a mile,  and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye,  he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into  the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a  silvery orb again.   “Excellent!” Lupin said, striding over to where Harry  sat. “Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!”   “Can we have another go? Just one more go?”   “Not now,” said Lupin firmly. “You’ve had enough for  one night. Here — ”   He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes’ best  chocolate “Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood.  Same time next week?”   “Okay,” said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate  and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had  rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor. A  thought had just occurred to him.   “Professor Lupin?” he said. “If you knew my dad, you  must’ve known Sirius Black as well.”   Lupin turned very quickly.   “What gives you that idea?” he said sharply.   “Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at  Hogwarts too. ...”   Lupin’s face relaxed.   “Yes, I knew him,” he said shortly. “Or I thought I did.  You’d better be off, Harry, it’s getting late.”   Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor  and around a corner, then took a detour behind a  suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish  his chocolate, wishing he hadn’t mentioned Black, as  Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then  Harry’s thoughts wandered back to his mother and  father. ...   He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he  was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear  his parents’ last moments replayed inside his head,  these were the only times Harry had heard their  voices since he was a very small child. But he’d never  be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half  wanted to hear his parents again. .. “They’re dead,” he told himself sternly. “They’re dead  and listening to echoes of them won’t bring them  back. You’d better get a grip on yourself if you want  that Quidditch Cup.”   He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into  his mouth, and headed back to Gryffindor Tower.   Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of  term. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to  Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would  take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He  therefore increased the number of team practices to  five a week. This meant that with Lupin’s anti-  dementor classes, which in themselves were more  draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just  one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he  wasn’t showing the strain nearly as much as  Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to  be getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione  was to be seen in a corner of the common room,  several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts,  rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy  objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she  barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was  interrupted.   “How’s she doing it?” Ron muttered to Harry one  evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on  Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up.  Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of  books.   “Doing what?”   “Getting to all her classes!” Ron said. “I heard her  talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch,  this morning. They were going on about yesterday’s  lesson, but Hermione can’t’ve been there, because sh was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie  McMillan told me she’s never missed a Muggle  Studies class, but half of them are at the same time  as Divination, and she’s never missed one of them  either!”   Harry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of  Hermione’s impossible schedule at the moment; he  really needed to get on with Snape’s essay. Two  seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this  time by Wood.   “Bad news, Harry. I’ve just been to see Professor  McGonagall about the Firebolt. She — er — got a bit  shirty with me. Told me I’d got my priorities wrong.  Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup  than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told  her I didn’t care if it threw you off, as long as you  caught the Snitch first.” Wood shook his head in  disbelief. “Honestly, the way she was yelling at me . . .  you’d think I’d said something terrible. ... Then I  asked her how much longer she was going to keep it.  ...” He screwed up his face and imitated Professor  McGonagall’s severe voice. “ ‘As long as necessary,  Wood’ ... I reckon it’s time you ordered a new broom,  Harry. There’s an order form at the back of Which  Broomstick ... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand  and One, like Malfoy’s got.”   “I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,” said  Harry flatly.   January faded imperceptibly into February, with no  change in the bitterly cold weather. The match  against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer,  but Harry still hadn’t ordered a new broom. He was  now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the  Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ro standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing  past with her face averted.   “No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor  McGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened,  before he’d even opened his mouth. “We’ve checked  for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick  believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I  shall tell you once we’ve finished checking it. Now,  please stop badgering me.”   To make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-dementor  lessons were not going nearly as well as he had  hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce  an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-  dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too  feeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was  hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry  of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt  angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to  hear his parents’ voices again.   “You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said  Professor Lupin sternly in their fourth week of  practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an  indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t  passing out anymore, are you?”   “I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors  down or something,” said Harry dispiritedly. “Make  them disappear — ”   “The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But  you’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of  time. If the dementors put in an appearance at your  next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them  at bay long enough to get back to the ground. “You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said  Harry.   “I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin,  smiling. “Here — you’ve earned a drink — something  from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have tried it  before — ”   He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.   “Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I  like that stuff!”   Lupin raised an eyebrow.   “Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back  from Hogsmeade,” Harry lied quickly.   “I see,” said Lupin, though he still looked slightly  suspicious. “Well — let’s drink to a Gryffindor victory  against Ravenclaw! Not that I’m supposed to take  sides, as a teacher ... ,” he added hastily.   They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry  voiced something he’d been wondering for a while.   “What’s under a dementor’s hood?”   Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.   “Hmmm ... well, the only people who really know are  in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor  lowers its hood only to use its last and worst  weapon.”   “What’s that?”   “They call it the Dementor’s Kiss,” said Lupin, with a  slightly twisted smile. “It’s what dementors do t those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there  must be some kind of mouth under there, because  they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim  and — and suck out his soul.”   Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.   “What — they kill — ?”   “Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much worse than that. You can  exist without your soul, you know, as long as your  brain and heart are still working. But you 11 have no  sense of self anymore, no memory, no ... anything.  There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just —  exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever  ... lost.”   Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, “It’s  the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily  Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the  dementors permission to perform it if they find him.”   Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of  someone having their soul sucked out through their  mouth. But then he thought of Black.   “He deserves it,” he said suddenly.   “You think so?” said Lupin lightly. “Do you really  think anyone deserves that?”   “Yes,” said Harry defiantly. “For ... for some things ...”   He would have liked to have told Lupin about the  conversation he’d overheard about Black in the Three  Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and  father, but it would have involved revealing that he’d  gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew  Lupin wouldn’t be very impressed by that. So h finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the  History of Magic classroom.   Harry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was  under a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so  horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of  what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of  you that he walked headlong into Professor  McGonagall halfway up the stairs.   “Do watch where you’re going, Potter!”   “Sorry, Professor — ”   “I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor  common room. Well, here it is, we’ve done everything  we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be  anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good  friend somewhere, Potter. ...”   Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his  Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.   “I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”   “Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was  actually smiling. “I daresay you’ll need to get the feel  of it before Saturday’s match, won’t you? And Potter  — do try and win, won’t you? Or we’ll be out of the  running for the eighth year in a row, as Professor  Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs  toward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he  saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to  ear “She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have  a go on it? Tomorrow?”   “Yeah ... anything ... said Harry, his heart lighter  than it had been in a month. “You know what — we  should make up with Hermione. ... She was only  trying to help. ...”   “Yeah, all right,” said Ron. “She’s in the common  room now — working, for a change — ”   They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and  saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan,  who seemed to be refusing him entrance.   “I wrote them down!” Neville was saying tearfully.   “But I must’ve dropped them somewhere!”   “A likely tale!” roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting  Harry and Ron: “Good even, my fine young yeomen!  Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force  entry to the chambers within!”   “Oh, shut up,” said Ron as he and Harry drew level  with Neville.   “I’ve lost the passwords!” Neville told them miserably.  “I made him tell me what passwords he was going to  use this week, because he keeps changing them, and  now I don’t know what I’ve done with them!”   “Oddsbodikins,” said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who  looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung  forward to let them into the common room. There was  a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and  the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people  exclaiming over his Firebolt.   “Where ’d you get it, Harry? “Will you let me have a go?”   “Have you ridden it yet, Harry?”   “Ravenclaw’ll have no chance, they’re all on  Cleansweep Sevens!”   “Can I just hold it, Harry?”   After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was  passed around and admired from every angle, the  crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view  of Hermione, the only person who hadn’t rushed over  to them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding  their eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and  at last, she looked up.   “I got it back,” said Harry, grinning at her and holding  up the Firebolt.   “See, Hermione? There wasn’t anything wrong with  it!” said Ron.   “Well — there might have been!” said Hermione. “I  mean, at least you know now that it’s safe!”   “Yeah, I suppose so,” said Harry. “I’d better put it  upstairs — ”   “I’ll take it!” said Ron eagerly. “I’ve got to give  Scabbers his rat tonic.”   He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made  of glass, carried it away up the boys’ staircase.   “Can I sit down, then?” Harry asked Hermione.   “I suppose so,” said Hermione, moving a great stack  of parchment off a chair Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the  long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still  glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay  (“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) and at the  rune translation Hermione was now poring over.   “How are you getting through all this stuff?” Harry  asked her.   “Oh, well — you know — working hard,” said  Hermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked  almost as tired as Lupin.   “Why don’t you just drop a couple of subjects?” Harry  asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for  her rune dictionary.   “I couldn’t do that!” said Hermione, looking  scandalized.   “Arithmancy looks terrible,” said Harry, picking up a  very complicated-looking number chart.   “Oh no, it’s wonderful!” said Hermione earnestly. “It’s  my favorite subject! It’s — ”   But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy,  Harry never found out. At that precise moment, a  strangled yell echoed down the boys’ staircase. The  whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at  the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing  louder and louder — and then Ron came leaping into  view, dragging with him a bedsheet.   “LOOK!” he bellowed, striding over to Hermione’s  table. “LOOK!” he yelled, shaking the sheets in her  face.   “Ron, what — ? “SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS! Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly  bewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was  holding. There was something red on it. Something  that looked horribly like —   “BLOOD!” Ron yelled into the stunned silence. “HE’S  GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE  FLOOR?”   “N — no,” said Hermione in a trembling voice.   Ron threw something down onto Hermione ’s rune  translation. Hermione and Harry leaned forward.  Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several  long, ginger cat hairs It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione’s  friendship. Each was so angry with the other that  Harry couldn’t see how they’d ever make up.   Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken  Crookshanks’s attempts to eat Scabbers seriously,  hadn’t bothered to keep a close enough watch on him,  and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was  innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers  under all the boys’ beds. Hermione, meanwhile,  maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that  Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger  hairs might have been there since Christmas, and  that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever  since Crookshanks had landed on Ron’s head in the  Magical Menagerie.   Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had  eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to  Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she  lost her temper with Harry too “Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!” she said  shrilly. “First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything’s  my fault, isn’t it! Just leave me alone, Harry, I’ve got a  lot of work to do!”   Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.   “Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring  Scabbers was,” said Fred bracingly “And he’s been  off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was  probably better for him to snuff it quickly — one  swallow — he probably didn’t feel a thing.”   “Fred\\” said Ginny indignantly.   “All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it  yourself,” said George.   “He bit Goyle for us once!” Ron said miserably.  “Remember, Harry?”   “Yeah, that’s true,” said Harry.   “His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight  face. “Let the scar on Goyle ’s finger stand as a lasting  tribute to his memory. Oh, come on, Ron, get yourself  down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what’s the  point of moaning?”   In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry  persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team’s  final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he  could have a ride on the Firebolt after they’d finished.  This did seem to take Ron’s mind off Scabbers for a  moment (“Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on  it?”) so they set off for the Quidditch field together.   Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor  practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just a impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had  been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave  them the benefit of her professional opinion.   “Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a  fault, it’s a slight list to the tail end — you often find  they develop a drag after a few years. They’ve updated  the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps,  reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they’ve  stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a  very fine old broom it was too. ...”   She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood  said, “Er — Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the  Firebolt back? We need to practice. ...”   “Oh — right — here you are, then, Potter,” said  Madam Hooch. “I’ll sit over here with Weasley ...”   She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and  the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his  final instructions for tomorrow’s match.   “Harry, I’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing  as Seeker. It’s Cho Chang. She’s a fourth year, and  she’s pretty good. ... I really hoped she wouldn’t be fit,  she’s had some problems with injuries. ...” Wood  scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a  full recovery, then said, “On the other hand, she rides  a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke  next to the Firebolt.” He gave Harry’s broom a look of  fervent admiration, then said, “Okay, everyone, let’s  g And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and  kicked off from the ground.   It was better than he’d ever dreamed. The Firebolt  turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey hi thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field  at such speed that the stadium turned into a green-  and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia  Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly  controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes  before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again —   “Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out!” Wood called.   Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal  posts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart  out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had  caught it tightly in his hand.   The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go  again, gave it a minute’s head start, then tore after it,  weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking  near Katie Bell’s knee, looped her easily, and caught  it again.   It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by  the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed  their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit  the ground again, Wood didn’t have a single criticism  to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a  first.   “I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow!” said  Wood. “Not unless — Harry, you’ve sorted out your  dementor problem, haven’t you?”   “Yeah,” said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus  and wishing it were stronger.   “The dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver.  Dumbledore’d go ballistic,” said Fred confidently “Well, let’s hope not,” said Wood. “Anyway — good  work, everyone. Let’s get back to the tower ... turn in  early — ”   “I’m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the  Firebolt,” Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the  team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode  over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands  and came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen  asleep in her seat.   “Here you go,” said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.   Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted  the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness  while Harry walked around the edge of the field,  watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch  awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not  waking her, and insisted that they go back to the  castle.   Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked  out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt’s  superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration,  and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward  the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw  something that made his heart turn over — a pair of  eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.   Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his  ribs.   “What’s the matter?” said Ron.   Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and  muttered, “Lumos\\ A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of  a tree, and illuminated its branches; there, crouching  among the budding leaves, was Crookshanks.   “Get out of here!” Ron roared, and he stooped down  and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he  could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished  with one swish of his long ginger tail.   “See?” Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down  again. “She’s still letting him wander about wherever  he wants — probably washing down Scabbers with a  couple of birds now. ...”   Harry didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath as  relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a  moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim.  They set off for the castle once more. Slightly  ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn’t say  anything to Ron — nor did he look left or right until  they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.   Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with  the rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of whom  seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard  of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads  turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was  a good deal of excited muttering. Harry saw, with  enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were  all looking thunderstruck.   “Did you see his face?” said Ron gleefully, looking  back at Malfoy. “He can’t believe it! This is brilliant!”   Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the  Firebolt.   “Put it here, Harry,” he said, laying the broom in the  middle of the table and carefully turning it so that it name faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and  Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.  Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on  having acquired such a superb replacement for his  Nimbus, and Percy’s Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope  Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the  Firebolt.   “Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily  as she examined the Firebolt closely “Penelope and I  have got a bet on,” he told the team. “Ten Galleons on  the outcome of the match!”   Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry,  and went back to her table.   “Harry — make sure you win,” said Percy, in an  urgent whisper. “I haven’t got ten Galleons. Yes, I’m  coming, Penny!” And he bustled off to join her in a  piece of toast.   “Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?” said a  cold, drawling voice.   Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe  and Goyle right behind him.   “Yeah, reckon so,” said Harry casually.   “Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it?” said Malfoy,  eyes glittering maliciously. “Shame it doesn’t come  with a parachute — in case you get too near a  dementor.”   Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.   “Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,”  said Harry. “Then it could catch the Snitch for you. The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy’s pale  eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched  him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put  their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether  Harry’s broom really was a Firebolt.   At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for  the locker rooms. The weather couldn’t have been  more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It  was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there  would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry,  though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement  only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear  the rest of the school moving into the stadium  beyond. Harry took off his black school robes,  removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it  inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his  Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn’t need it.  He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was  in the crowd, watching.   “You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they  prepared to leave the locker rooms. “If we lose this  match, we’re out of the running. Just — just fly like  you did in practice yesterday, and we’ll be okay!”   They walked out onto the field to tumultuous  applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were  already standing in the middle of the field. Their  Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team.  She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and  Harry couldn’t help noticing, nervous as he was, that  she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the  teams faced each other behind their captains, and he  felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he  didn’t think had anything to do with nerves “Wood, Davies, shake hands,” Madam Hooch said  briskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw  Captain.   “Mount your brooms ... on my whistle . . . three — two  — one — ”   Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed  higher and faster than any other broom; he soared  around the stadium and began squinting around for  the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary,  which was being provided by the Weasley twins’  friend Lee Jordan.   “They’re off, and the big excitement this match is the  Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor.  According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt’s going to  be the broom of choice for the national teams at this  year’s World Championship — ”   “Jordan, would you mind telling us what’s going on in  the match?” interrupted Professor McGonagall’s voice.   “Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of  background information — the Firebolt, incidentally,  has a built-in auto-brake and — ”   “Jordan!”   “Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of  Gryffindor heading for goal ...”   Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction,  gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho  Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly  a very good flier — she kept cutting across him,  forcing him to change direction “Show her your acceleration, Harry!” Fred yelled as he  whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was  aiming for Alicia.   Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the  Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as  Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match,  and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw  it — the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near  one of the barriers.   Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore  after him — Harry was speeding up, excitement  flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet  away —   Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters,  came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course,  avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial  seconds, the Snitch had vanished.   There was a great “Ooooooh” of disappointment from  the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for  their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley  vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger  directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll  right over in midair to avoid it.   “Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at  that Firebolt go! Potter’s really putting it through its  paces now, see it turn — Chang’s Comet is just no  match for it, the Firebolt’s precision-balance is really  noticeable in these long — ”   “JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE  FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!”   Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored  three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty point ahead — if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw  would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a  Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically — a  glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings — the Snitch was  circling the Gryffindor goal post —   Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold  ahead — but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air,  blocking him —   “HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!”  Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision.  “KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!”   Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was  grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry  turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet  above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw  Cho following him. ... She’d decided to mark him  rather than search for the Snitch herself. . . . All right,  then ... if she wanted to tail him, she’d have to take  the consequences. ...   He dived again, and Cho, thinking he’d seen the  Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive  very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a  bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time  — the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the  Ravenclaw end.   He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was  winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second —  then —   “Oh!” screamed Cho, pointing.   Distracted, Harry looked down Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors,  were looking up at him.   He didn’t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the  neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and  roared, “Expecto patronum).”   Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted  from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot  directly at the dementors but didn’t pause to watch;  his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead —  he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still  grasping his wand and just managed to close his  fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.   Madam Hooch’s whistle sounded. Harry turned  around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing  down on him; next moment, the whole team was  hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his  broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the  Gryffindors in the crowd.   “That’s my boy!” Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina,  and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip  so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off.  In complete disarray, the team managed to make its  way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and  looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters  sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he  knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.   “Yes!” Ron yelled, yanking Harry’s arm into the air.  “Yes! Yes!”   “Well done, Harry!” said Percy, looking delighted. “Ten  Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me — ”   “Good for you, Harry!” roared Seamus Finnigan “Ruddy brilliant!” boomed Hagrid over the heads of  the milling Gryffindors.   “That was quite some Patronus,” said a voice in  Harry’s ear.   Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who  looked both shaken and pleased.   “The dementors didn’t affect me at all!” Harry said  excitedly. “I didn’t feel a thing!”   “That would be because they — er — weren’t  dementors,” said Professor Lupin. “Come and see — ”   He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to  see the edge of the field.   “You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,” said Lupin.   Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground  were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the  Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove  themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked  as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle ’s  shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of  the utmost fury on her face, was Professor  McGonagall.   “An unworthy trick!” she was shouting. “A low and  cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker!  Detention for all of you, and fifty points from  Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor  Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here  he comes now!”   If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor’s  victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way  through to Harry’s side, doubled up with laughter a they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from  the robe, Goyle’s head still stuck inside it “Come on, Harry!” said George, fighting his way over.  “Party! Gryffindor common room, now!”   “Right,” said Harry, and feeling happier than he had  in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still  in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up  to the castle It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch  Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night.  Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of  hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of  butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of  Honeydukes sweets.   “How did you do that?” squealed Angelina Johnson as  George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the  crowd.   “With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and  Prongs,” Fred muttered in Harry’s ear.   Only one person wasn’t joining in the festivities.  Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner,  attempting to read an enormous book entitled Home  Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke  away from the table where Fred and George had  started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to  her.   “Did you even come to the match?” he asked her.   “Of course I did,” said Hermione in a strangely high-  pitched voice, not looking up. “And I’m very glad w won, and I think you did really well, but I need to  read this by Monday.”   “Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,”  Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering  whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the  hatchet.   “I can’t, Harry. I’ve still got four hundred and twenty-  two pages to read!” said Hermione, now sounding  slightly hysterical. “Anyway ...” She glanced over at  Ron too. “He doesn’t want me to join in.”   There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that  moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn’t just been  eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies.  He used to really like them — ”   Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or  do anything, she tucked the enormous book under  her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase  to the girls’ dormitories and out of sight.   “Can’t you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron  quietly.   “No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was  sorry — but she’ll never admit she’s wrong, Hermione.  She’s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation  or something.”   The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor  McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown  and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they  all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to  their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last,  exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the  hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray o moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly  drifting off to sleep. ...   He had a very strange dream. He was walking  through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder,  following something silvery- white. It was winding its  way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch  glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up  with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his  quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard  hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out,  and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a  corner into a clearing and —   “AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH  ! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”   Harry woke as suddenly as though he’d been hit in  the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he  fumbled with his hangings — he could hear  movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan’s voice  from the other side of the room: “What’s going on?”   Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At  last finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them  back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his  lamp.   Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one  side, a look of utmost terror on his face.   “Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!”   “What?”   “Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!”  “You sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?” said Dean “Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!”   They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the  dormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the  staircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy  voices called after them.   “Who shouted?”   “What ’re you doing?”   The common room was lit with the glow of the dying  fire, still littered with the debris from the party. It was  deserted.   “Are you sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?”   “I’m telling you, I saw him!”   “What’s all the noise?”   “Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!”   A few of the girls had come down their staircase,  pulling on dressing gowns and yawning. Boys, too,  were reappearing.   “Excellent, are we carrying on?” said Fred Weasley  brightly.   “Everyone back upstairs!” said Percy,  hurrying into the common room and pinning his  Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.   “Perce — Sirius Black!” said Ron faintly. “In our  dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up!”   The common room went very still “Nonsense!” said Percy, looking startled. “You had too  much to eat, Ron — had a nightmare —  “I’m telling you — ”   “Now, really, enough’s enough!”   Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the  portrait behind her as she entered the common room  and stared furiously around.   “I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but  this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of  you!”   “I certainly didn’t authorize this, Professor!” said  Percy, puffing himself up indignantly. “I was just  telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron  here had a nightmare — ”   “IT WASNT A NIGHTMARE!” Ron yelled.   “PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS  STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!”   Professor McGonagall stared at him.   “Don’t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly  have gotten through the portrait hole?”   “Ask him!” said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the  back of Sir Cadogan’s picture. “Ask him if he saw — ”   Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall  pushed the portrait back open and went outside. The  whole common room listened with bated breath.   “Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor  Tower? “Certainly, good lady!” cried Sir Cadogan.   There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside  the common room.   “You — you did?” said Professor McGonagall. “But —  but the password!”   “He had ’em!” said Sir Cadogan proudly. “Had the  whole week’s, my lady! Read ’em off a little piece of  paper!”   Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the  portrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was  white as chalk.   “Which person,” she said, her voice shaking, “which  abysmally foolish person wrote down this week’s  passwords and left them lying around?”   There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of  terrified squeaks. Neville Longbottom, trembling from  head to fluffy-slippered toes, raised his hand slowly  into the air SNAPE’S No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They  knew that the castle was being searched again, and  the whole House stayed awake in the common room,  waiting to hear whether Black had been caught.  Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell  them that he had again escaped.   Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw  signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be  seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large  picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling  up and down the corridors, boarding up everything  from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir  Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken  back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and  the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly  restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had  agreed to return to her job only on condition that she  was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security  trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the  corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and  comparing the size of their clubs Harry couldn’t help noticing that the statue of the  one-eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded  and unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George had  been right in thinking that they — and now Harry,  Ron, and Hermione — were the only ones who knew  about the hidden passageway within it.   “D’you reckon we should tell someone?” Harry asked  Ron.   “We know he’s not coming in through Honey duke’s,”  said Ron dismissively “We’d’ve heard if the shop had  been broken into.”   Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed  witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to  go into Hogsmeade again.   Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first  time in his life, people were paying more attention to  him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was  rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely  shaken by the night’s events, he was happy to tell  anyone who asked what had happened, with a wealth  of detail.   \"... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I  thought it was in my dream, you know? But then  there was this draft ... I woke up and one side of the  hangings on my bed had been pulled down. ... I rolled  over . . . and I saw him standing over me . . . like a  skeleton, with loads of filthy hair . . . holding this great  long knife, must’ve been twelve inches ... and he  looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled,  and he scampered.   “Why, though?” Ron added to Harry as the group of  second-year girls who had been listening to his  chilling tale departed. “Why did he run? Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had  Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron  and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve  years ago that he didn’t mind murdering innocent  people, and this time he had been facing five  unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.   “He must’ve known he’d have a job getting back out of  the castle once you’d yelled and woken people up,”  said Harry thoughtfully. “He’d’ve had to kill the whole  House to get back through the portrait hole . . . then  he would’ve met the teachers. ...”   Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall  was so furious with him she had banned him from all  future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and  forbidden anyone to give him the password into the  tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the  common room every night for somebody to let him in,  while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him.  None of these punishments, however, came close to  matching the one his grandmother had in store for  him. Two days after Black’s break-in, she sent Neville  the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive  over breakfast — a Howler.   The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying  the mail as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn  owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched  in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite  him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once — Ron  had got one from his mother the year before.   “Run for it, Neville,” Ron advised.   Neville didn’t need telling twice. He seized the  envelope, and holding it before him like a bomb,  sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table  exploded with laughter at the sight of him. The heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall —  Neville’s grandmother’s voice, magically magnified to  a hundred times its usual volume, shrieking about  how he had brought shame on the whole family.   Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice  immediately that he had a letter too. Hedwig got his  attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist.   “Ouch! Oh — thanks, Hedwig.”   Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped  herself to some of Neville’s cornflakes. The note inside  said:   Dear Harry and Ron,   How about having tea with me this afternoon ’round  six I’ll come and collect you from the castle.   WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL;   YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN  Cheers,   Hagrid   “He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said  Ron.   So at six o’clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left  Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run,  and headed down to the entrance hall.   Hagrid was already waiting for them “All right, Hagrid!” said Ron. “S’pose you want to hear  about Saturday night, do you?”   “I’ve already heard all abou’ it,” said Hagrid, opening  the front doors and leading them outside.   “Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly put out.   The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid’s cabin  was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of  Hagrid’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded  tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead  ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight,  Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very  horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of  Hagrid’s wardrobe door.   “What are they for, Hagrid?” said Harry.   “Buckbeak’s case against the Committee fer the  Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures,” said Hagrid. “This  Friday. Him an’ me’ll be goin’ down ter London  together. I’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus. ...”   Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely  forgotten that Buckbeak’s trial was so near, and  judging by the uneasy look on Ron’s face, he had too.  They had also forgotten their promise about helping  him prepare Buckbeak’s defense; the arrival of the  Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.   Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of  Bath buns, but they knew better than to accept; they  had had too much experience with Hagrid’s cooking.   “I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two,” said  Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking  uncharacteristically serious “What?” said Harry.   “Hermione,” said Hagrid.   “What about her?” said Ron.   “She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin cornin’  down ter visit me a lot since Chris ’mas. Bin feelin’  lonely. Firs’ yeh weren’ talking to her because o’ the  Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat — ”   “ — ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily.   “Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid  continued doggedly. “She’s cried a fair few times, yeh  know. Goin’ through a rough time at the moment.  Bitten off more’n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the  work she’s tryin’ ter do. Still found time ter help me  with Buckbeak’s case, mind. ... She’s found some  really good stuff fer me ... reckon he’ll stand a good  chance now. ...”   “Hagrid, we should’ve helped as well — sorry — ”   Harry began awkwardly.   “I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said Hagrid, waving Harry’s  apology aside. “Gawd knows yeh’ve had enough ter be  gettin’ on with. I’ve seen yeh practicin’ Quidditch ev’ry  hour o’ the day an’ night — but I gotta tell yeh, I  thought you two’d value yer friend more’n  broomsticks or rats. Tha’s all.”   Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.   “Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed  yeh, Ron. She’s got her heart in the right place,  Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her —  “If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her  again!” Ron said angrily. “But she’s still sticking up  for it! It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word  against it!”   “Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou’ their pets,”  said Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few  ferret bones onto Hagrid’s pillow.   They spent the rest of their visit discussing  Gryffindor’s improved chances for the Quidditch Cup.  At nine o’clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the  castle.   A large group of people was bunched around the  bulletin board when they returned to the common  room.   “Hogsmeade, next weekend!” said Ron, craning over  the heads to read the new notice. “What d’you  reckon?” he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit  down.   “Well, Filch hasn’t done anything about the passage  into Honeydukes. ...” Harry said, even more quietly.   “Harry!” said a voice in his right ear. Harry started  and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at  the table right behind them and clearing a space in  the wall of books that had been hiding her.   “Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again ... I’ll tell  Professor McGonagall about that map!” said  Hermione.   “Can you hear someone talking, Harry?” growled Ron,  not looking at Hermione “Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what  Sirius Black nearly did to youl I mean it, I’ll tell — ”   “So now you’re trying to get Harry expelled!” said Ron  furiously. “Haven’t you done enough damage this  year?”   Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a  soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione  took one frightened look at the expression on Ron’s  face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away  toward the girls’ dormitories.   “So how about it?” Ron said to Harry as though there  had been no interruption. “Come on, last time we  went you didn’t see anything. You haven’t even been  inside Zonko’s yet!”   Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well  out of earshot.   “Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak  this time.”   On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility  Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder’s Map into his  pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone  else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down  the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was  careful to let her see him walking back up the marble  staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else  proceeded to the front doors.   “ ’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get  back!”   Ron grinned and winked Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the  Marauder’s Map out of his pocket as he went.  Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it  out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry  squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read  Neville Longbottom.   Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered,   “ Dissendium).” and shoved his bag into the statue, but  before he could climb in himself, Neville came around  the corner.   “Harry! I forgot you weren’t going to Hogsmeade  either!”   “Hi, Neville,” said Harry, moving swiftly away from the  statue and pushing the map back into his pocket.  “What are you up to?”   “Nothing,” shrugged Neville. “Want a game of  Exploding Snap?”   “Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and  do that vampire essay for Lupin — ”   “I’ll come with you!” said Neville brightly. “I haven’t  done it either!”   “Er — hang on — yeah, I forgot, I finished it last  night!”   “Great, you can help me!” said Neville, his round face  anxious. “I don’t understand that thing about the  garlic at all — do they have to eat it, or — ”   He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry’s  shoulder.   It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry “And what are you two doing here?” said Snape,  coming to a halt and looking from one to the other.  “An odd place to meet — ”   To Harry’s immense disquiet, Snape’s black eyes  flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and  then to the one-eyed witch.   “We’re not — meeting here,” said Harry. “We just —  met here.”   “Indeed?” said Snape. “You have a habit of turning up  in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely  there for no good reason. ... I suggest the pair of you  return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.”   Harry and Neville set off without another word. As  they turned the corner, Harry looked back. Snape was  running one of his hands over the one-eyed witch’s  head, examining it closely.   Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by  telling him the password, then pretending he’d left his  vampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once  out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out the  map again and held it close to his nose.   The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry  scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of  relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was  now back in its office.   He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her  hump, heaved himself inside, and slid down to meet  his bag at the bottom of the stone chute. He wiped  the Marauder’s Map blank again, then set off at a  run Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility  Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes  and prodded Ron in the back.   “It’s me,” he muttered.   “What kept you?” Ron hissed.   “Snape was hanging around. ...”   They set off up the High Street.   “Where are you?” Ron kept muttering out of the  corner of his mouth. “Are you still there? This feels  weird. ...”   They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be  checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that  Harry could have a good look around. The owls sat  hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of  them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops  owls (“Local Deliveries Only”), which were so small  they could have sat in the palm of Harry’s hand.   Then they visited Zonko’s, which was so packed with  students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread  on anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and  tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s wildest  dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed  him some gold from under the cloak. They left  Zonko’s with their money bags considerably lighter  than they had been on entering, but their pockets  bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn  Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece.   The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt  like staying indoors, so they walked past the Three  Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the  Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling i Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the  village, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with  its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.   “Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,” said Ron as they  leaned on the fence, looking up at it. “I asked Nearly  Headless Nick ... he says he’s heard a very rough  crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George  tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just  considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes  when they heard voices nearby. Someone was  climbing toward the house from the other side of the  hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed  closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking.   \"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He  had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm . . .  about how I couldn’t use it for three months. ...”   Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.   “I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron  trying to defend himself ... There’s no ’arm in ’im,  ’onest — ’ . . . that hippogriff’s as good as dead — ”   Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face  split in a malevolent grin.   “What are you doing, Weasley?”   Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.   “Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you,  Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom?   I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that  true? Harry seized the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from  leaping on Malfoy.   “Leave him to me,” he hissed in Ron’s ear.   The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept  silently around behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,  bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of  the path.   “We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,” Malfoy  said to Ron. “Just trying to imagine what he’s saying  to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous  Creatures. D’you think he’ll cry when they cut off his  hippogriff’s — ”   SPLAT.   Malfoy’s head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his  silver-blond hair was suddenly dripping in muck.   “What the — ?”   Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself  standing, he was laughing so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe,  and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly  around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.   “What was that? Who did that?”   “Very haunted up here, isn’t it?” said Ron, with the  air of one commenting on the weather.   Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging  muscles were no use against ghosts. Malfoy was  staring madly around at the deserted landscape Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly  sloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling, green  sludge.   SPLATTER.   Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle  hopped furiously on the spot, trying to rub it out of  his small, dull eyes.   “It came from over there!” said Malfoy, wiping his  face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of  Harry.   Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms  outstretched like a zombie. Harry dodged around him,  picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe ’s back.  Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a  kind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had  thrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could  see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck  out his leg. Crabbe stumbled — and his huge, flat foot  caught the hem of Harry’s cloak. Harry felt a great  tug, then the cloak slid off his face.   For a split second, Malfoy stared at him.   “AAARGH!” he yelled, pointing at Harry’s head. Then  he turned tail and ran, at breakneck speed, back  down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind him.   Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was  done.   “Harry!” Ron said, stumbling forward and staring  hopelessly at the point where Harry had disappeared,  “you’d better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone — you’d  better get back to the castle, quick —  “See you later,” said Harry, and without another  word, he tore back down the path toward Hogsmeade Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would  anyone believe Malfoy? Nobody knew about the  Invisibility Cloak — nobody except Dumbledore.  Harry’s stomach turned over — Dumbledore would  know exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said  anything —   Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps,  across the stone floor, through the trapdoor — Harry  pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran,  flat out, along the passage. ... Malfoy would get back  first . . . how long would it take him to find a teacher?  Panting, a sharp pain in his side, Harry didn’t slow  down until he reached the stone slide. He would have  to leave the cloak where it was, it was too much of a  giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher — he  hid it in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast  as he could, his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of  the chute. He reached the inside of the witch’s hump,  tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, and  hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as  Harry jumped out from behind the statue, he heard  quick footsteps approaching.   It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk,  his black robes swishing, then stopped in front of  him.   “So,” he said.   There was a look of suppressed triumph about him.  Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his  sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickly  hid in his pockets.   “Come with me, Potter,” said Snape Harry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his  hands clean on the inside of his robes without Snape  noticing. They walked down the stairs to the  dungeons and then into Snape’s office.   Harry had been in here only once before, and he had  been in very serious trouble then too. Snape had  acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars  since last time, all standing on shelves behind his  desk, glinting in the firelight and adding to the  threatening atmosphere.   “Sit,” said Snape.   Harry sat. Snape, however, remained standing.   “Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange  story, Potter,” said Snape.   Harry didn’t say anything.   “He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack  when he ran into Weasley — apparently alone.”   Still, Harry didn’t speak.   “Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to  Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit him in the  back of the head. How do you think that could have  happened?”   Harry tried to look mildly surprised.   “I don’t know, Professor.”   Snape’s eyes were boring into Harry’s. It was exactly  like trying to stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard  not to blink “Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition.   Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?”   “No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently  curious.   “It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.”   There was a long silence.   “Maybe he’d better go to Madam Pomfrey,” said Harry.  “If he’s seeing things like — ”   “What would your head have been doing in  Hogsmeade, Potter?” said Snape softly. “Your head is  not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has  permission to be in Hogsmeade.”   “I know that,” said Harry, striving to keep his face free  of guilt or fear. “It sounds like Malfoy’s having  hallucin — ”   “Malfoy is not having hallucinations,” snarled Snape,  and he bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry’s  chair, so that their faces were a foot apart. “If your  head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.”   “I’ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,” said Harry. “Like  you told — ”   “Can anyone confirm that?”   Harry didn’t say anything. Snape’s thin mouth curled  into a horrible smile.   “So,” he said, straightening up again. “Everyone from  the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to  keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But  famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself. Let th ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry  Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for  the consequences.”   Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him  into telling the truth. He wasn’t going to do it. Snape  had no proof — yet.   “How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,”  Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He too was  exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the  Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above  the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his  friends and admirers . . . The resemblance between you  is uncanny.”   “My dad didn’t strut,” said Harry, before he could stop  himself. “And neither do I.”   “Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,”  Snape went on, pressing his advantage, his thin face  full of malice. “Rules were for lesser mortals, not  Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen — ”   “SHUT UP!”   Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had  not felt since his last night in Privet Drive was  coursing through him. He didn’t care that Snape’s  face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing  dangerously.   “ What did you say to me, Potter?”   “I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled. “I  know the truth, all right? He saved your life!  Dumbledore told me! You wouldn’t even be here if it  wasn’t for my dad! Snape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.   “And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances  in which your father saved my life?” he whispered.   “Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for  precious Potter’s delicate ears?”   Harry bit his lip. He didn’t know what had happened  and didn’t want to admit it — but Snape seemed to  have guessed the truth.   “I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of  your father, Potter,” he said, a terrible grin twisting  his face. “Have you been imagining some act of  glorious heroism? Then let me correct you — your  saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing  joke on me that would have resulted in my death if  your father hadn’t got cold feet at the last moment.  There was nothing brave about what he did. He was  saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke  succeeded, he would have been expelled from  Hogwarts.”   Snape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.   “Turn out your pockets, Potter!” he spat suddenly.   Harry didn’t move. There was a pounding in his ears.   “Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the  headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!”   Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of  Zonko’s tricks and the Marauder’s Map.   Snape picked up the Zonko’s bag “Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a  chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. “He —  brought them back from Hogsmeade last time — ”   “Indeed? And you’ve been carrying them around ever  since? How very touching . . . and what is this?”   Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his  might to keep his face impassive.   “Spare bit of parchment,” he said with a shrug.   Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.   “Surely you don’t need such a very old piece of  parchment?” he said. “Why don’t I just — throw this  away?”   His hand moved toward the fire.   “No!” Harry said quickly.   “So!” said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. “Is this  another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it —  something else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible  ink? Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without  passing the dementors?”   Harry blinked. Snape ’s eyes gleamed.   “Let me see, let me see ... ,” he muttered, taking out  his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk.  “Reveal your secret!” he said, touching the wand to  the parchment.   Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop  them from shaking “Show yourself!” Snape said, tapping the map  sharply.   It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming  breaths.   “Professor Severus Snape, master of this school,  commands you to yield the information you conceal!”  Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.   As though an invisible hand were writing upon it,  words appeared on the smooth surface of the map.   “Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor  Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large  nose out of other people’s business.”   Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the  message. But the map didn’t stop there. More writing  was appearing beneath the first.   “Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to  add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.”   It would have been very funny if the situation hadn’t  been so serious. And there was more. ...   “Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment  that an idiot like that ever became a professor.”   Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he’d opened  them, the map had had its last word.   “Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and  advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.”   Harry waited for the blow to fall.   “So ... ,” said Snape softly. “We’ll see about this. ... He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of  glittering powder from ajar on the fireplace, and  threw it into the flames.   “Lupin!” Snape called into the fire. “I want a word!”   Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large  shape had appeared in it, revolving very fast. Seconds  later, Professor Lupin was clambering out of the  fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.   “You called, Severus?” said Lupin mildly.   “I certainly did,” said Snape, his face contorted with  fury as he strode back to his desk. “I have just asked  Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.”   Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words  of Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs  were still shining. An odd, closed expression appeared  on Lupin’s face.   “Well?” said Snape.   Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the  impression that Lupin was doing some very quick  thinking.   “Well?” said Snape again. “This parchment is plainly  full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of  expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got  such a thing?”   Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in  Harry’s direction, warned him not to interrupt.   “Full of Dark Magic?” he repeated mildly. “Do you  really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is  merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody wh reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I  imagine Harry got it from a joke shop — ”   “Indeed?” said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with  anger. “You think a joke shop could supply him with  such a thing? You don’t think it more likely that he  got it directly from the manufacturers?”   Harry didn’t understand what Snape was talking  about. Nor, apparently, did Lupin.   “You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?”  he said. “Harry, do you know any of these men?”   “No,” said Harry quickly.   “You see, Severus?” said Lupin, turning back to  Snape. “It looks like a Zonko product to me — ”   Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He  was completely out of breath, and stopped just short  of Snape ’s desk, clutching the stitch in his chest and  trying to speak.   “I — gave — Harry — that — stuff,” he choked.  “Bought — it ... in Zonko ’s ... ages — ago ...”   “Well!” said Lupin, clapping his hands together and  looking around cheerfully. “That seems to clear that  up! Severus, I’ll take this back, shall I?” He folded the  map and tucked it inside his robes. “Harry, Ron,  come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay  — excuse us, Severus — ”   Harry didn’t dare look at Snape as they left his office.  He, Ron, and Lupin walked all the way back into the  entrance hall before speaking. Then Harry turned to  Lupin “Professor, I —  “I don’t want to hear explanations,” said Lupin  shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall  and lowered his voice. “I happen to know that this  map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago.   Yes, I know it’s a map,” he said as Harry and Ron  looked amazed. “I don’t want to know how it fell into  your possession. I am, however, astounded that you  didn’t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the  last time a student left information about the castle  lying around. And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.”   Harry had expected that, and was too keen for  explanations to protest.   “Why did Snape think I’d got it from the  manufacturers?”   “Because ... ,” Lupin hesitated, “because these  mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of  school. They’d think it extremely entertaining.”   “Do you know them?” said Harry, impressed.   “We’ve met,” he said shortly. He was looking at Harry  more seriously than ever before.   “Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I  cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously. But I  would have thought that what you have heard when  the dementors draw near you would have had more of  an effect on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep  you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them —  gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.”   He walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far  than he had at any point in Snape ’s office. Slowly, he  and Ron mounted the marble staircase. As Harr passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the  Invisibility Cloak — it was still down there, but he  didn’t dare go and get it “It’s my fault,” said Ron abruptly. “I persuaded you to  go. Lupin’s right, it was stupid, we shouldn’t’ve don it —  He broke off; they reached the corridor where the  security trolls were pacing, and Hermione was  walking toward them. One look at her face convinced  Harry that she had heard what had happened. His  heart plummeted — had she told Professor  McGonagall?   “Come to have a good gloat?” said Ron savagely as  she stopped in front of them. “Or have you just been  to tell on us?”   “No,” said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her  hands and her lip was trembling. “I just thought you  ought to know ... Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is  going to be executed. “He — he sent me this,” Hermione said, holding out  the letter.   Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and  enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in  places that it was very difficult to read.   Dear Hermione,   We lost I’m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.  Execution date to be fixed.   Beaky has enjoyed London.   I won’t forget all the help you gave us.   Hagrid   “They can’t do this,” said Harry. “They can’t.  Buckbeak isn’t dangerous. “Malfoy’s dad’s frightened the Committee into it,” said  Hermione, wiping her eyes. “You know what he’s like.  They’re a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were  scared. There’ll be an appeal, though, there always is.  Only I can’t see any hope. ... Nothing will have  changed.”   “Yeah, it will,” said Ron fiercely. “You won’t have to do  all the work alone this time, Hermione. I’ll help.”   “Oh, Ron!”   Hermione flung her arms around Ron’s neck and  broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified,  patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head.  Finally, Hermione drew away.   “Ron, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers ... ,” she  sobbed.   “Oh — well — he was old,” said Ron, looking  thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him. “And  he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad  might get me an owl now.”   The safety measures imposed on the students since  Black’s second break-in made it impossible for Harry,  Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the  evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was  during Care of Magical Creatures lessons.   He seemed numb with shock at the verdict.   “S’all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin’  there in black robes an’ I kep’ droppin’ me notes and  forgettin’ all them dates yeh looked up fer me,  Hermione. An’ then Lucius Malfoy stood up an’ said  his bit, and the Committee jus’ did exac’ly what he  told ’em. ... “There’s still the appeal!” said Ron fiercely. “Don’t give  up yet, we’re working on it!”   They were walking back up to the castle with the rest  of the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was  walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking  back, laughing derisively.   “S’no good, Ron,” said Hagrid sadly as they reached  the castle steps. “That Committee’s in Lucius Malfoy ’s  pocket. I’m jus’ gonna make sure the rest o’ Beaky’s  time is the happiest he’s ever had. I owe him that. ...”   Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his  cabin, his face buried in his handkerchief.   “Look at him blubber!”   Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just  inside the castle doors, listening.   “Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said  Malfoy. “And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”   Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward  Malfoy, but Hermione got there first — SMACK!   She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the  strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry,  Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as  Hermione raised her hand again.   “Don’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you  evil — ”   “Hermione!” said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her  hand as she swung it back.   “Get off, Ron! Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped  backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for  instructions, thoroughly bewildered.   “C’mon,” Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three  of them had disappeared into the passageway to the  dungeons.   “Hermionel” Ron said again, sounding both stunned  and impressed.   “Harry, you’d better beat him in the Quidditch final!”  Hermione said shrilly. “You just better had, because I  can’t stand it if Slytherin wins!”   “We’re due in Charms,” said Ron, still goggling at  Hermione. “We’d better go.”   They hurried up the marble staircase toward  Professor Flitwick’s classroom.   “You’re late, boys!” said Professor Flitwick reprovingly  as Harry opened the classroom door. “Come along,  quickly, wands out, we’re experimenting with  Cheering Charms today, we’ve already divided into  pairs — ”   Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and  opened their bags. Ron looked behind him.   “Where’s Hermione gone?”   Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn’t entered  the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right  next to him when he had opened the door.   “That’s weird,” said Harry, staring at Ron. “Maybe —  maybe she went to the bathroom or something? But Hermione didn’t turn up all lesson.   “She could’ve done with a Cheering Charm on her  too,” said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning  broadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a  feeling of great contentment.   Hermione wasn’t at lunch either. By the time they  had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the  Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and  Ron had started to get slightly worried.   “You don’t think Malfoy did something to her?” Ron  said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward  Gryffindor Tower.   They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the  password (“Flibbertigibbet”), and scrambled through  the portrait hole into the common room.   Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head  resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit  down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake.   “Wh — what?” said Hermione, waking with a start  and staring wildly around. “Is it time to go? W —  which lesson have we got now?   “Divination, but it’s not for another twenty minutes,”  said Harry. “Hermione, why didn’t you come to  Charms?”   “What? Oh no!” Hermione squeaked. “I forgot to go to  Charms!”   “But how could you forget?” said Harry. “You were  with us till we were right outside the classroom! “I don’t believe it!” Hermione wailed. “Was Professor  Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking  about him and I lost track of things!”   “You know what, Hermione?” said Ron, looking down  at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had  been using as a pillow. “I reckon you’re cracking up.  You’re trying to do too much.”   “No, I’m not!” said Hermione, brushing her hair out of  her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. “I  just made a mistake, that’s all! I’d better go and see  Professor Flitwick and say sorry. ... I’ll see you in  Divination!”   Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to  Professor Trelawney’s classroom twenty minutes later,  looking extremely harassed.   “I can’t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet  they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted  they might!”   Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling  tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal  ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and  Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table.   “I thought we weren’t starting crystal balls until next  term,” Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for  Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby.   “Don’t complain, this means we’ve finished  palmistry,” Harry muttered back. “I was getting sick  of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.”   “Good day to you!” said the familiar, misty voice, and  Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic  entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavende quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky  glow of their crystal ball “I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little  earlier than I had planned,” said Professor Trelawney,  sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around.  “The fates have informed me that your examination in  June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give  you sufficient practice.”   Hermione snorted.   “Well, honestly ... ‘the fates have informed her’ ... who  sets the exam? She does! What an amazing  prediction!” she said, not troubling to keep her voice  low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.   It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had  heard them, as her face was hidden in shadow. She  continued, however, as though she had not.   “Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,” she said  dreamily. “I do not expect any of you to See when first  you peer into the Orb’s infinite depths. We shall start  by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and  external eyes” — Ron began to snigger uncontrollably  and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the  noise — “so as to clear the Inner Eye and the  superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you  will See before the end of the class.”   And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely  foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to  keep his mind empty when thoughts such as “this is  stupid” kept drifting across it. It didn’t help that Ron  kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept  tutting “Seen anything yet?” Harry asked them after a  quarter of an hour’s quiet crystal gazing.   “Yeah, there’s a burn on this table,” said Ron,  pointing. “Someone’s spilled their candle.”   “This is such a waste of time,” Hermione hissed. “I  could be practicing something useful. I could be  catching up on Cheering Charms — ”   Professor Trelawney rustled past.   “Would anyone like me to help them interpret the  shadowy portents within their Orb?” she murmured  over the clinking of her bangles.   “I don’t need help,” Ron whispered. “It’s obvious what  this means. There’s going to be loads of fog tonight.”   Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.   “Now, really!” said Professor Trelawney as everyone’s  heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender  were looking scandalized. “You are disturbing the  clairvoyant vibrations!” She approached their table  and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart  sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming —   “There is something here!” Professor Trelawney  whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it was  reflected twice in her huge glasses. “Something  moving . . . but what is it?”   Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned,  including his Firebolt, that it wasn’t good news,  whatever it was. And sure enough —   “My dear ... ,” Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing  up at Harry. “It is here, plainer than ever before ... m dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer ... the  Gr —  “Oh, for goodness’ sake!” said Hermione loudly. “Not  that ridiculous Grim again\\”   Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to  Hermione ’s face. Parvati whispered something to  Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too.  Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione  with unmistakable anger.   “I am sorry to say that from the moment you have  arrived in this class, my dear, it has been apparent  that you do not have what the noble art of Divination  requires. Indeed, I don’t remember ever meeting a  student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”   There was a moment’s silence. Then —   “Fine!” said Hermione suddenly, getting up and  cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag.  “Fine!” she repeated, swinging the bag over her  shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. “I  give up! I’m leaving!”   And to the whole class’s amazement, Hermione strode  over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed  down the ladder out of sight.   It took a few minutes for the class to settle down  again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten  all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry  and Ron’s table, breathing rather heavily as she  tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.   “Ooooo!” said Lavender suddenly, making everyone  start. “Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I’ve just  remembered! You saw her leaving, didn’t you? Didn’ you, Professor? ‘Around Easter, one of our number will  leave us forever*.’ You said it ages ago, Professor!”   Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.   “Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger  would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one  might have mistaken the Signs. ... The Inner Eye can  be a burden, you know. ...”   Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and  moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join  their table instead.   “Some day Hermione’s having, eh?” Ron muttered to  Harry, looking awed.   “Yeah ...”   Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing  but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney  really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing  he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the  Quidditch final drawing ever nearer.   The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The  third years had never had so much homework. Neville  Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and  he wasn’t the only one.   “Call this a holiday!” Seamus Finnigan roared at the  common room one afternoon. “The exams are ages  away, what’re they playing at?”   But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even  without Divination, she was taking more subjects  than anybody else. She was usually last to leave the  common room at night, first to arrive at the librar the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin’s  under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears.   Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak’s  appeal. When he wasn’t doing his own work, he was  poring over enormously thick volumes with names  like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl  or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so  absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to  Crookshanks.   Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around  Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless  discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-  Slytherin match would take place on the first  Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was  leading the tournament by exactly two hundred  points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his  team) that they needed to win the match by more  than that amount to win the Cup. It also meant that  the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because  capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty  points.   “So you must catch it only if we’re more than fifty  points up,” Wood told Harry constantly. “Only if we’re  more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match  but lose the Cup. You’ve got that, haven’t you? You  must catch the Snitch only if we’re — ”   “I KNOW, OLIVER!” Harry yelled.   The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the  coming match. Gryffindor hadn’t won the Quidditch  Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron’s  second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry  doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to  win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry  and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy wa still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in  Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry  had somehow wormed his way out of punishment.  Harry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to sabotage  him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the  matter of Buckbeak that made him most determined  to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.   Never, in anyone’s memory, had a match approached  in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the  holidays were over, tension between the two teams  and their Houses was at the breaking point. A  number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors,  culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor  fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the  hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.   Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He  couldn’t walk to class without Slytherins sticking out  their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle  kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching  away looking disappointed when they saw him  surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions  that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he  went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of  action. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the  challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible  for Harry to get to classes on time because he was  surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was  more concerned for his Firebolt’s safety than his own.  When he wasn’t flying it, he locked it securely in his  trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor  Tower at break times to check that it was still there.   All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor  common room the night before the match. Even  Hermione had put down her books.   “I can’t work, I can’t concentrate,” she said nervously There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George  Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being  louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood  was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the  corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand  and muttering to himself. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie  were laughing at Fred’s and George’s jokes. Harry was  sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the  center of things, trying not to think about the next  day, because every time he did, he had the horrible  sensation that something very large was fighting to  get out of his stomach.   “You’re going to be fine,” Hermione told him, though  she looked positively terrified.   “You’ve got a Firebolti” said Ron.   “Yeah ... ,” said Harry, his stomach writhing.   It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and  yelled, “Team! Bed! Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had  overslept, and that Wood was yelling, “Where were  you? We had to use Neville instead!” Then he dreamed  that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived  for the match riding dragons. He was flying at  breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames  from Malfoy ’s steed’s mouth, when he realized he had  forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and  woke with a start.   It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that  the match hadn’t taken place yet, that he was safe in  bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t  be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling ver thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-  poster and went to pour himself some water from the  silver jug beneath the window.   The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind  disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the  Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent-  looking. It looked as though the conditions for the  match would be perfect.   Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back  to his bed when something caught his eye. An animal  of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn.   Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his  glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the  window. It couldn’t be the Grim — not now — not  right before the match —   He peered out at the grounds again and, after a  minute’s frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting  the edge of the forest now. ... It wasn’t the Grim at all  ...it was a cat. ... Harry clutched the window ledge in  relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only  Crookshanks. ...   Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted,  pressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks  seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he  could see something else moving in the shadow of the  trees too.   And just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black  dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks  trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean?  If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it  be an omen of Harry’s death?   “Ron!” Harry hissed. “Ron! Wake up! “Huh? “I need you to tell me if you can see something!”   “S’all dark, Harry,” Ron muttered thickly. “What’re  you on about?”   “Down here — ”   Harry looked quickly back out of the window.   Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry  climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into  the shadows of the castle, but they weren’t there.  Where had they gone?   A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.   Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the  Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry  couldn’t help grinning broadly as he saw that both  the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding  them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they  passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler  than usual.   Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to  eat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried  them off to the field before anyone else had finished,  so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they  left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.   “Good luck, Harry!” called Cho. Harry felt himself  blushing.   “Okay — no wind to speak of — sun’s a bit bright,  that could impair your vision, watch out for it —   ground’s fairly hard, good, that’ll give us a fast kickoff  ? Wood paced the field, staring around with the team  behind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the  castle open in the distance and the rest of the school  spilling onto the lawn.   “Locker rooms,” said Wood tersely.   None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet  robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he  was: as though he’d eaten something extremely  wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at  all, Wood was saying, “Okay, it’s time, let’s go — ”   They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise.  Three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet  rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion  upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like  “GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE CUP!”  Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two  hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent  of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor  Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like  everyone else, and a very grim smile.   “And here are the Gryffindors!” yelled Lee Jordan,  who was acting as commentator as usual. “Potter,   Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood.  Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has  seen in a good few years — ”   Lee’s comments were drowned by a tide of “boos” from  the Slytherin end.   “And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain  Flint. He’s made some changes in the lineup and  seems to be going for size rather than skill — ”   More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however,  thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily th smallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest of  them were enormous “Captains, shake hands!” said Madam Hooch.   Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped  each other’s hand very tightly; it looked as though  each was trying to break the other’s fingers.   “Mount your brooms!” said Madam Hooch. “Three ...  two ... one ...”   The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the  crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt  his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him  in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw  Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the  Snitch.   “And it’s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of  Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the  Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no —  Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of  Slytherin tearing up the field — WHAM! — nice  Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington  drops the Quaffle, it’s caught by — Johnson,  Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina —  nice swerve around Montague — duck, Angelina,  that’s a Bludger] — SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO  GRYFFINDOR!”   Angelina punched the air as she soared around the  end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was  screaming its delight —   “OUCH!”   Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as  Marcus Flint went smashing into her “Sorry!” said Flint as the crowd below booed. “Sorry,  didn’t see her!”   A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater’s  club at the back of Flint’s head. Flint’s nose smashed  into the handle of his broom and began to bleed.   “That will do!” shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming  between them. “Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an  unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to  Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!”   “Come off it, Miss!” howled Fred, but Madam Hooch  blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the  penalty.   “Come on, Alicia!” yelled Lee into the silence that had  descended on the crowd. “YES! SHE’S BEATEN THE  KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!”   Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still  bleeding freely, fly forward to take the Slytherin  penalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor  goal posts, his jaw clenched.   “ ’Course, Wood’s a superb Keeper!” Lee Jordan told  the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch’s whistle.  “Superb! Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed   — YES! I DONT BELIEVE IT! HE’S SAVED IT!”   Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the  Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of  Lee’s commentary. It was essential that he hold  Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than  fifty points up —   “Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession   — no! — Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Kati Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she’s  streaking up the field — THAT WAS DELIBERATE! Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of  Katie, and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed  her head. Katie cartwheeled in the air, managed to  stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.   Madam Hooch’s whistle rang out again as she soared  over to Montague and began shouting at him. A  minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the  Slytherin Seeker.   “THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY,   “Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way   — !”   “I’m telling it like it is, Professor!”   Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the  Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the  Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn’t catch it yet —  and if Malfoy saw it —   Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled  his Firebolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin  end — it worked. Malfoy went haring after him,  clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there. ...   WHOOSH.   One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry’s right  ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick.   Then again —   WHOOSH The second Bludger grazed Harry’s elbow. The other  Beater, Bole, was closing in.   Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick  zooming toward him, clubs raised —   He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and  Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.   “Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters  lurched away from each other, clutching their heads.  “Too bad, boys! You’ll need to get up earlier than that  to beat a Firebolt! And it’s Gryffindor in possession  again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside  her — poke him in the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke,  Professor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in  possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal  posts, come on now, Wood, save — !”   But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers  from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that  Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical  megaphone away from him.   “Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won’t happen again! So,  Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and  Gryffindor in possession — ”   It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever  played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an  early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any  means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his  club and tried to say he’d thought she was a Bludger.  George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in  retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams  penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular  save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still  keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match,  looking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty  points ahead —   Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were  swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the  Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick  took advantage of Fred’s and George’s absence to aim  both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the  stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the  air, clutching his broom, completely winded.   Madam Hooch was beside herself.   “YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE  QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!” she  shrieked at Bole and Derrick. “Gryffindor penalty!”   And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred  Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the  Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it  through the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten.   The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself  hoarse — Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and  if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs.  Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following  him as he soared around the field, high above the rest  of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him.   And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty  feet above him.   Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was  roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but  suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down  Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown  himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt’s tail,  and was pulling it back.   “You — ”   Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn’t  reach — Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding  onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling  maliciously. He had achieved what he’d wanted to do  — the Snitch had disappeared again.   “Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I’ve never seen such  tactics!” Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to  where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two  Thousand and One.   “YOU CHEATING SCUM!” Lee Jordan was howling  into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor  McGonagall’s reach. “YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B — ”   Professor McGonagall didn’t even bother to tell him  off. She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy’s  direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was  shouting furiously.   Alicia took Gryffindor’s penalty, but she was so angry  she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was  losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by  Malfoy’s foul on Harry, were being spurred on to  greater heights.   “Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal —  Montague scores — ” Lee groaned. “Seventy-twenty to  Gryffindor. ...”   Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees  kept hitting each other. Harry wasn’t going to let  Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch. .. “Get out of it, Potter!” Malfoy yelled in frustration as  he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him.   “Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor,  come on, Angelina, COME ON!”   Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player  apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward  Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were  all going to block her —   Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he  was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.  Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins.   “AAAAAAARRRGH ! ”   They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them;  Angelina’s way was clear.   “SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by  eighty points to twenty!”   Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the  stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and  zoomed back into the middle of the field.   And then he saw something to make his heart stand  still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face  — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny,  golden glimmer —   Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was  miles ahead —   “Go! Go! Go!” Harry urged his broom. He was gaining  on Malfoy — Harry flattened himself to the broom  handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at  Malfoy’s ankles — he was level  Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his  broom. He knocked Malfoy’s arm out of the way an “YES!”   He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the  stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an  odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held  tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against  his fingers.   Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by  tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed  unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large  thumps as Fred and George hit them; then  Angelina’s, Alicia’s, and Katie’s voices, “We’ve won the  Cup\\ We’ve won the Cup\\” Tangled together in a  many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling  hoarsely, back to earth.   Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring  over the barriers onto the field. Hands were raining  down on their backs. Harry had a confused  impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him.  Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto  the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he  saw Hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh  beat ’em, Harry, yeh beat ’em! Wait till I tell  Buckbeak!” There was Percy, jumping up and down  like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor  McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood,  wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag;  and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron  and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply  beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where  Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous  Quidditch Cup If only there had been a dementor around. ... As a  sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it  into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the  world’s best Patronus PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S  Harry’s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup  lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be  celebrating; as June approached, the days became  cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing  was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on  the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice,  perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or  watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across  the surface of the lake.   But they couldn’t. Exams were nearly upon them, and  instead of lazing around outside, the students were  forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their  brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of  summer air drifted in through the windows. Even  Fred and George Weasley had been spotted working;  they were about to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary  Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his  N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the  highest qualification Hogwarts offered. As Perc hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top  grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave  very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed  the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact,  the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy  was Hermione.   Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was  managing to attend several classes at once, but they  couldn’t restrain themselves when they saw the exam  schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first  column read:   Monday   9 o’clock, Arithmancy  9 o’clock, Transfiguration  Lunch   1 o’clock, Charms  1 o’clock, Ancient Runes   “Hermione?” Ron said cautiously, because she was  liable to explode when interrupted these days. “Er —  are you sure you’ve copied down these times right?”   “What?” snapped Hermione, picking up the exam  schedule and examining it. “Yes, of course I have.”   “Is there any point asking how you’re going to sit for  two exams at once?” said Harry.   “No,” said Hermione shortly. “Have either of you seen  my copy of Numerology and Gramatica? “Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,”  said Ron, but very quietly. Hermione started shifting  heaps of parchment around on her table, looking for  the book. Just then, there was a rustle at the window  and Hedwig fluttered through it, a note clutched tight  in her beak.   “It’s from Hagrid,” said Harry, ripping the note open.  “Buckbeak’s appeal — it’s set for the sixth.”   “That’s the day we finish our exams,” said Hermione,  still looking everywhere for her Arithmancy book.   “And they’re coming up here to do it,” said Harry, still  reading from the letter. “Someone from the Ministry of  Magic and — and an executioner.”   Hermione looked up, startled.   “They’re bringing the executioner to the appeal! But  that sounds as though they’ve already decided!”   “Yeah, it does,” said Harry slowly.   “They can’t!” Ron howled. “I’ve spent ages reading up  on stuff for him; they can’t just ignore it all!”   But Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee  for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had had its  mind made up for it by Mr. Malfoy. Draco, who had  been noticeably subdued since Gryffindor’s triumph  in the Quidditch final, seemed to regain some of his  old swagger over the next few days. From sneering  comments Harry overheard, Malfoy was certain  Buckbeak was going to be killed, and seemed  thoroughly pleased with himself for bringing it about.  It was all Harry could do to stop himself imitating  Hermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these  occasions. And the worst thing of all was that the had no time or opportunity to go and see Hagrid,  because the strict new security measures had not  been lifted, and Harry didn’t dare retrieve his  Invisibility Cloak from below the one-eyed witch.   k k  Exam week began and an unnatural hush fell over  the castle. The third years emerged from  Transfiguration at lunchtime on Monday, limp and  ashen-faced, comparing results and bemoaning the  difficulty of the tasks they had been set, which had  included turning a teapot into a tortoise. Hermione  irritated the rest by fussing about how her tortoise  had looked more like a turtle, which was the least of  everyone else’s worries.   “Mine still had a spout for a tail, what a nightmare “Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?”   “It still had a willow-patterned shell, d’you think  that 11 count against me?”   Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back  upstairs for the Charms exam. Hermione had been  right; Professor Flitwick did indeed test them on  Cheering Charms. Harry slightly overdid his out of  nerves and Ron, who was partnering him, ended up  in fits of hysterical laughter and had to be led away to  a quiet room for an hour before he was ready to  perform the charm himself. After dinner, the students  hurried back to their common rooms, not to relax,  but to start studying for Care of Magical Creatures,  Potions, and Astronomy Hagrid presided over the Care of Magical Creatures  exam the following morning with a very preoccupied  air indeed; his heart didn’t seem to be in it at all. He  had provided a large tub of fresh flobberworms for the  class, and told them that to pass the test, their  flobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one  hour. As flobberworms flourished best if left to their  own devices, it was the easiest exam any of them had  ever taken, and also gave Harry, Ron, and Hermione  plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.   “Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed,” Hagrid told them,  bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry’s  flobberworm was still alive. “Bin cooped up too long.  But still ... we’ll know day after tomorrow — one way  or the other — ”   They had Potions that afternoon, which was an  unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn’t  get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape,  standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure,  scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a  zero onto his notes before moving away.   Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest  tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in  which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue  had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while  wishing he could have had one of Fortescue ’s choco-  nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom.  Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the  greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to  the common room once more, with sunburnt necks,  thinking longingly of this time next day, when it  would all be over.   Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was  Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had  compiled the most unusual exam any of them ha ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the  sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling  pool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes  full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of  marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a  hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle  with a new boggart.   “Excellent, Harry,” Lupin muttered as Harry climbed  out of the trunk, grinning. “Full marks.”   Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to  watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he  reached the hinkypunk, which successfully confused  him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire.  Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached  the trunk with the boggart in it. After about a minute  inside it, she burst out again, screaming.   “Hermione!” said Lupin, startled. “What’s the matter?”   “P — P — Professor McGonagall!” Hermione gasped,  pointing into the trunk. “Sh — she said I’d failed  everything!”   It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at  last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry,  and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly  inclined to laugh at Hermione ’s boggart, but an  argument was averted by the sight that met them on  the top of the steps.   Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped  cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds.  He started at the sight of Harry.   “Hello there, Harry!” he said. “Just had an exam, I  expect? Nearly finished? “Yes,” said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on  speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered  awkwardly in the background.   “Lovely day,” said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.  “Pity ... pity ...”   He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.   “I’m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The  Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures  required a witness to the execution of a mad  hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on  the Black situation, I was asked to step in.”   “Does that mean the appeal’s already happened?” Ron  interrupted, stepping forward.   “No, no, it’s scheduled for this afternoon,” said Fudge,  looking curiously at Ron.   “Then you might not have to witness an execution at  all!” said Ron stoutly. “The hippogriff might get off!”   Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came  through the castle doors behind him. One was so  ancient he appeared to be withering before their very  eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin  black mustache. Harry gathered that they were  representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of  Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard  squinted toward Hagrid’s cabin and said in a feeble  voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this. ... Two  o’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?”   The black-mustached man was fingering something in  his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running  one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe.   Ron opened his mouth to say something, bu Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her  head toward the entrance hall.   “Why’d you stop me?” said Ron angrily as they  entered the Great Hall for lunch. “Did you see them?  They’ve even got the axe ready! This isn’t justice!”   “Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can’t go  saying things like that to his boss!” said Hermione,  but she too looked very upset. “As long as Hagrid  keeps his head this time, and argues his case  properly, they can’t possibly execute Buckbeak. ...”   But Harry could tell Hermione didn’t really believe  what she was saying. All around them, people were  talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily  anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but  Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid  and Buckbeak, didn’t join in.   Harry’s and Ron’s last exam was Divination;  Hermione’s, Muggle Studies. They walked up the  marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the  first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way  up to the seventh, where many of their class were  sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney’s  classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute  studying.   “She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them  as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy  of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages  devoted to crystal gazing. “Have either of you ever  seen anything in a crystal ball?” he asked them  unhappily.   “Nope,” said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept  checking his watch; Harry knew that he was counting  down the time until Buckbeak’s appeal started The line of people outside the classroom shortened  very slowly. As each person climbed back down the  silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, “What did  she ask? Was it okay?”   But they all refused to say.   “She says the crystal ball’s told her that if I tell you,   I’ll have a horrible accident!” squeaked Neville as he  clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and  Ron, who had now reached the landing.   “That’s convenient,” snorted Ron. “You know, I’m  starting to think Hermione was right about her” — he  jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead —  “she’s a right old fraud.”   “Yeah,” said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was  now two o’clock. “Wish she’d hurry up ...”   Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with  pride.   “She says I’ve got all the makings of a true Seer,” she  informed Harry and Ron. “I saw loads of stuff. ... Well,  good luck!”   She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward  Lavender.   “Ronald Weasley,” said the familiar, misty voice from  over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed  the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only  person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor  with his back against the wall, listening to a fly  buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the  grounds with Hagrid Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron’s large feet  reappeared on the ladder.   “How’d it go?” Harry asked him, standing up.   “Rubbish,” said Ron. “Couldn’t see a thing, so I made  some stuff up. Don’t think she was convinced,  though. ...”   “Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as  Professor Trelawney’s voice called, “Harry Potter!”   The tower room was hotter than ever before; the  curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the  usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled  through the clutter of chairs and tables to where  Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large  crystal ball.   “Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would  kindly gaze into the Orb. ... Take your time, now ...  then tell me what you see within it. ...”   Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as  hard as he could, willing it to show him something  other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.   “Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately.  “What do you see?”   The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were  stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the  fire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just  said, and decided to pretend.   “Er — ” said Harry, “a dark shape ... um ...”   “What does it resemble?” whispered Professor  Trelawney. “Think, now ... Harry cast his mind around and it landed on  Buckbeak.   “A hippogriff,” he said firmly.   “Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling  keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees.  “My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor  Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look  closer. . . . Does the hippogriff appear to . . . have its  head?”   “Yes,” said Harry firmly.   “Are you sure?” Professor Trelawney urged him. “Are  you quite sure, dear? You don’t see it writhing on the  ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe  behind it?”   “No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.   “No blood? No weeping Hagrid?”   “No!” said Harry again, wanting more than ever to  leave the room and the heat. “It looks fine, it’s —  flying away. ...”   Professor Trelawney sighed.   “Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there. ... A little  disappointing ... but I’m sure you did your best.”   Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned  to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.   “It will happen tonight. Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone  rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and  her mouth sagging.   “S — sorry?” said Harry.   But Professor Trelawney didn’t seem to hear him. Her  eyes started to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She  looked as though she was about to have some sort of  seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the  hospital wing — and then Professor Trelawney spoke  again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own:   “The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned  by his followers. His servant has been chained these  twelve years. Tonight, before midnight ... the servant  will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The  Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid,  greater and more terrible than ever he was. Tonight ...  before midnight . . . the servant . . . will set out ... to  rejoin ... his master. ...”   Professor Trelawney’s head fell forward onto her  chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat  there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor  Trelawney’s head snapped up again.   “I’m so sorry, dear boy,” she said dreamily, “the heat  of the day, you know ... I drifted off for a moment. ...”   Harry sat there, staring at her.   “Is there anything wrong, my dear?”   “You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord’s  going to rise again ... that his servant’s going to go  back to him. ...”   Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled “The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My  dear boy, that’s hardly something to joke about. ...  Rise again, indeed — ”   “But you just said it! You said the Dark Lord — ”   “I think you must have dozed off too, dear!” said  Professor Trelawney. “I would certainly not presume  to predict anything quite as far-fetched as that\\”   Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral  staircase, wondering ... had he just heard Professor  Trelawney make a real prediction? Or had that been  her idea of an impressive end to the test?   Five minutes later he was dashing past the security  trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower,  Professor Trelawney’s words still resounding in his  head. People were striding past him in the opposite  direction, laughing and joking, heading for the  grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the  time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the  common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the  corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione.   “Professor Trelawney,” Harry panted, “just told me — ”   But he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.   “Buckbeak lost,” said Ron weakly. “Hagrid’s just sent  this.”   Hagrid’s note was dry this time, no tears had  splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so  much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.   Lost appeal. They’re going to execute at sunse Nothing you can do. Don’t come down I don’t want you to see it  Hagrid   “We’ve got to go,” said Harry at once. “He can’t just sit  there on his own, waiting for the executioner!”   “Sunset, though,” said Ron, who was staring out the  window in a glazed sort of way. “We’d never be  allowed ... ’specially you, Harry. ...”   Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking.   “If we only had the Invisibility Cloak. ...”   “Where is it?” said Hermione.   Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway  under the one-eyed witch.   \"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m  in serious trouble,” he finished.   “That’s true,” said Hermione, getting to her feet. “If he  sees you. ... How do you open the witch’s hump  again?”   “You — you tap it and say, ‘Dissendium,’ ” said Harry.  “But — ”   Hermione didn’t wait for the rest of his sentence; she  strode across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady’s  portrait and vanished from sight.   “She hasn’t gone to get it?” Ron said, staring after  her She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour  later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her  robes.   “Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten into you  lately!” said Ron, astounded. “First you hit Malfoy,  then you walk out on Professor Trelawney — ”   Hermione looked rather flattered.   They went down to dinner with everybody else, but  did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry  had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he  had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They  skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall,  listening, until they were sure it was deserted. They  heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall  and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head  around the door.   “Okay,” she whispered, “no one there — cloak on — ”   Walking very close together so that nobody would see  them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the  cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into  the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the  Forbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the  trees.   They reached Hagrid’s cabin and knocked. He was a  minute in answering, and when he did, he looked all  around for his visitor, pale-faced and trembling.   “It’s us,” Harry hissed. “We’re wearing the Invisibility  Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off.”   “Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered, but he  stood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the  door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon  their necks. He looked like a man who did not know  where he was or what to do. This helplessness was  worse to watch than tears.   “Wan’ some tea?” he said. His great hands were  shaking as he reached for the kettle.   “Where’s Buckbeak, Hagrid?” said Hermione  hesitantly.   “I — I took him outside,” said Hagrid, spilling milk all  over the table as he filled up the jug. “He’s tethered in  me pumpkin patch. Thought he oughta see the trees  an’ — an’ smell fresh air — before — ”   Hagrid ’s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug  slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the  floor.   “I’ll do it, Hagrid,” said Hermione quickly, hurrying  over and starting to clean up the mess.   “There’s another one in the cupboard,” Hagrid said,  sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve.  Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.   “Isn’t there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?” Harry  asked fiercely, sitting down next to him. “Dumbledor “He’s tried,” said Hagrid. “He’s got no power ter  overrule the Committee. He told ’em Buckbeak’s all  right, but they’re scared. ... Yeh know what Lucius  Malfoy’s like ... threatened ’em, I expect ... an’ the  executioner, Macnair, he’s an old pal o’ Malfoy’s ...  but it’ll be quick an’ clean ... an’ I’ll be beside him. ... Hagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the  cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or  comfort.   “Dumbledore ’s gonna come down while it — while it  happens. Wrote me this mornin’. Said he wants ter —  ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore. ...”   Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid ’s  cupboard for another milk jug, let out a small, quickly  stifled sob. She straightened up with the new jug in  her hands, fighting back tears.   “Well stay with you too, Hagrid,” she began, but  Hagrid shook his shaggy head.   “Yeh’re ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don’  wan’ yeh watchin’. An’ yeh shouldn’ be down here  anyway. ... If Fudge an’ Dumbledore catch yeh out  without permission, Harry, yehll be in big trouble.”   Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione ’s  face, but she hid them from Hagrid, bustling around  making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to  pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.   “Ron! I — I don’t believe it — it’s Scabbersl”   Ron gaped at her.   “What are you talking about?”   Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and  turned it upside down. With a frantic squeak, and  much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat  came sliding out onto the table.   “Scabbers!” said Ron blankly. “Scabbers, what are  you doing here? He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the  light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than  ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide  bald patches, and he writhed in Ron’s hands as  though desperate to free himself.   “It’s okay, Scabbers!” said Ron. “No cats! There’s  nothing here to hurt you!”   Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the  window. His normally ruddy face had gone the color  of parchment.   “They’re cornin’. ...”   Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group  of men was walking down the distant castle steps. In  front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard  gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted  Cornelius Fudge. Behind them came the feeble old  Committee member and the executioner, Macnair.   “Yeh gotta go,” said Hagrid. Every inch of him was  trembling. “They mustn’ find yeh here. ... Go now. ...”   Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione  picked up the cloak.   “I’ll let yeh out the back way,” said Hagrid.   They followed him to the door into his back garden.  Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when  he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree  behind Hagrid’s pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to  know something was happening. He turned his sharp  head from side to side and pawed the ground  nervously “It’s okay, Beaky,” said Hagrid softly. “It’s okay ...” He  turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Go on,” he  said. “Get goin’.”   But they didn’t move.   “Hagrid, we can’t — ”   “Well tell them what really happened — ”   “They can’t kill him — ”   “Go!” said Hagrid fiercely. “It’s bad enough without  you lot in trouble an’ all!”   They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak  over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of  the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had  just vanished from sight.   “Go quick,” he said hoarsely. “Don’ listen. ...”   And he strode back into his cabin as someone  knocked at the front door.   Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and  Hermione set off silently around Hagrid’s house. As  they reached the other side, the front door closed with  a sharp snap.   “Please, let’s hurry,” Hermione whispered. “I can’t  stand it, I can’t bear it. ...”   They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle.  The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to  a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west there was  a ruby-red glow.   Ron stopped dead “Oh, please, Ron,” Hermione began.   “It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put — ”   Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his  pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking  madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth  into Ron’s hand.   “Scabbers, it’s me, you idiot, it’s Ron,” Ron hissed.   They heard a door open behind them and men’s  voices.   “Oh, Ron, please let’s move, they’re going to do it!”  Hermione breathed.   “Okay — Scabbers, stay put — ”   They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was  trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind  them. Ron stopped again.   “I can’t hold him — Scabbers, shut up, everyone’ll  hear us — ”   The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough  to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid’s garden.  There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a  silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable  swish and thud of an axe.   Hermione swayed on the spot.   “They did it!” she whispered to Harry. “I d — don’t  believe it — they did it! CAT, RAT,   Harry’s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of  them stood transfixed with horror under the  Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun  were casting a bloody light over the long-shadowed  grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild  howling.   “Hagrid,” Harry muttered. Without thinking about  what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both  Ron and Hermione seized his arms.   “We can’t,” said Ron, who was paper-white. “He’ll be  in worse trouble if they know we’ve been to see him Hermione ’s breathing was shallow and uneven.   “How — could — they?” she choked. “How could  they?”   “Come on,” said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be  chattering They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to  keep themselves hidden under the cloak. The light  was fading fast now. By the time they reached open  ground, darkness was settling like a spell around  them.   “Scabbers, keep still,” Ron hissed, clamping his hand  over his chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron  came to a sudden halt, trying to force Scabbers  deeper into his pocket. “What’s the matter with you,  you stupid rat? Stay still — OUCH! He bit me!”   “Ron, be quiet!” Hermione whispered urgently.  “Fudge’ll be out here in a minute — ”   “He won’t — stay — put — ”   Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with  all his might, trying to break free of Ron’s grip.   “What’s the matter with him?”   But Harry had just seen — slinking toward them, his  body low to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting  eerily in the darkness — Crookshanks. Whether he  could see them or was following the sound of  Scabbers’s squeaks, Harry couldn’t tell.   “Crookshanks!” Hermione moaned. “No, go away,  Crookshanks! Go away!”   But the cat was getting nearer —   “Scabbers — NO!”   Too late — the rat had slipped between Ron’s  clutching fingers, hit the ground, and scampered  away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him,  and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ro had thrown the Invisibility Cloak off himself and  pelted away into the darkness “Ron\\” Hermione moaned.   She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at  a sprint; it was impossible to run full out under the  cloak; they pulled it off and it streamed behind them  like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could  hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts  at Crookshanks.   “Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come  here — ”   There was a loud thud.   “Gotchal Get off, you stinking cat — ”   Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they  skidded to a stop right in front of him. He was  sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in  his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the  quivering lump.   “Ron — come on — back under the cloak — ”   Hermione panted. “Dumbledore — the Minister —  they’ll be coming back out in a minute — ”   But before they could cover themselves again, before  they could even catch their breath, they heard the  soft pounding of gigantic paws. ... Something was  bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow — an  enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog.   Harry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog  had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit  him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a whirl  of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth  But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled  off him. Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were  broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it  growling as it skidded around for a new attack.   Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward  them he pushed Harry aside; the dog’s jaws fastened  instead around Ron’s outstretched arm. Harry lunged  forward, he seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it  was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a  rag doll —   Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard  across the face he was knocked off his feet again. He  heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.   Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his  eyes —   “Lumos\\” he whispered.   The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree;  they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the  Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as  though in a high wind, whipping backward and  forward to stop them going nearer.   And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog,  dragging Ron backward into a large gap in the roots  — Ron was fighting furiously, but his head and torso  were slipping out of sight —   “Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy  branch whipped lethally through the air and he was  forced backward again.   All they could see now was one of Ron’s legs, which  he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the  dog from pulling him farther underground — but  horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron’s leg  had broken, and a moment later, his foot vanished  from sight.   “Harry — we’ve got to go for help — ” Hermione  gasped; she was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her  across the shoulder.   “No! That thing’s big enough to eat him; we haven’t  got time — ”   “Harry — we’re never going to get through without  help — ”   Another branch whipped down at them, twigs  clenched like knuckles.   “If that dog can get in, we can,” Harry panted, darting  here and there, trying to find a way through the  vicious, swishing branches, but he couldn’t get an  inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of  the tree’s blows.   “Oh, help, help,” Hermione whispered frantically,  dancing uncertainly on the spot, “please ...”   Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between  the battering branches like a snake and placed his  front paws upon a knot on the trunk.   Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to  marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or  shook.   “Crookshanks!” Hermione whispered uncertainly. She  now grasped Harry’s arm painfully hard. “How did he  know — ? “He’s friends with that dog,” said Harry grimly. “I’ve  seen them together. Come on — and keep your wand  out — ”   They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds,  but before they had reached the gap in the roots,  Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his  bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward,  headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the  bottom of a very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a little  way along, his eyes flashing in the light from Harry’s  wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside  him.   “Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice.   “This way,” said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after  Crookshanks.   “Where does this tunnel come out?” Hermione asked  breathlessly from behind him.   “I don’t know. ... It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map  but Fred and George said no one’s ever gotten into it.  ...It goes off the edge of the map, but it looked like it  was heading for Hogsmeade. ...”   They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double;  ahead of them, Crookshanks ’s tail bobbed in and out  of view. On and on went the passage; it felt at least as  long as the one to Honeydukes. ... All Harry could  think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might  be doing to him. ... He was drawing breath in sharp,  painful gasps, running at a crouch. ...   And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it  twisted, and Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry  could see a patch of dim light through a small  opening He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging  forward. Both raised their wands to see what lay  beyond.   It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper  was peeling from the walls; there were stains all over  the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as  though somebody had smashed it. The windows were  all boarded up.   Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very  frightened but nodded.   Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around.  The room was deserted, but a door to their right stood  open, leading to a shadowy hallway. Hermione  suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm again. Her wide eyes  were traveling around the boarded windows.   “Harry,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking  Shack.”   Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair  near them. Large chunks had been torn out of it; one  of the legs had been ripped off entirely.   “Ghosts didn’t do that,” he said slowly.   At that moment, there was a creak overhead.  Something had moved upstairs. Both of them looked  up at the ceiling. Hermione ’s grip on Harry’s arm was  so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers. He raised  his eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.   Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and  up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered  in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide  shiny stripe had been made by something being  dragged upstairs They reached the dark landing “Nox,” they whispered together, and the lights at the  end of their wands went out. Only one door was open.  As they crept toward it, they heard movement from  behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring.  They exchanged a last look, a last nod.   Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door  wide open.   On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings  lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them.  On the floor beside him, clutching his leg, which  stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.   Harry and Hermione dashed across to him.   “Ron — are you okay?”   “Where’s the dog?”   “Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with  pain. “Harry, it’s a trap — ”   “What — ”   “He’s the dog ... he’s an Animagus. ...”   Ron was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled  around. With a snap, the man in the shadows closed  the door behind them.   A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If  eyes hadn’t been shining out of the deep, dark  sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy skin  was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it  looked like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a  grin. It was Sirius Black “ ExpelliarmusV’ he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at  them.   Harry’s and Hermione’s wands shot out of their  hands, high in the air, and Black caught them. Then  he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed on Harry.   “I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said  hoarsely. His voice sounded as though he had long  since lost the habit of using it. “Your father would  have done the same for me. Brave of you, not to run  for a teacher. I’m grateful ... it will make everything  much easier. ...”   The taunt about his father rang in Harry’s ears as  though Black had bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted  in Harry’s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first  time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his hand,  not to defend himself, but to attack ... to kill. Without  knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but  there was a sudden movement on either side of him  and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him  back. ... “No, Harry!” Hermione gasped in a petrified  whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black.   “If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us too!”  he said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright  was draining him of still more color, and he swayed  slightly as he spoke.   Something flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes.   “Lie down,” he said quietly to Ron. “You will damage  that leg even more.”   “Did you hear me?” Ron said weakly, though he was  clinging painfully to Harry to stay upright. “You’ll  have to kill all three of us! “There’ll be only one murder here tonight,” said Black,  and his grin widened “Why’s that?” Harry spat, trying to wrench himself  free of Ron and Hermione. “Didn’t care last time, did  you? Didn’t mind slaughtering all those Muggles to  get at Pettigrew. ... What’s the matter, gone soft in  Azkaban?”   “Harry!” Hermione whimpered. “Be quiet!”   “HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!” Harry roared, and  with a huge effort he broke free of Hermione ’s and  Ron’s restraint and lunged forward —   He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that  he was short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black  was a tall, full-grown man — all Harry knew was that  he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and  that he didn’t care how much he got hurt in return —   Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so  stupid, but Black didn’t raise the wands in time —  one of Harry’s hands fastened over his wasted wrist,  forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry’s  other hand collided with the side of Black’s head and  they fell, backward, into the wall —   Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was  a blinding flash as the wands in Black’s hand sent a  jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry’s face by  inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers  twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand  punching every part of Black it could find.   But Black’s free hand had found Harry’s throat —   “No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long —  The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses  askew.   Then he saw Hermione ’s foot swing out of nowhere.  Black let go of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had  thrown himself on Black’s wand hand and Harry  heard a faint clatter —   He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own  wand rolling across the floor; he threw himself toward  it but —   “Argh!”   Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front  claws had sunk themselves deep into Harry’s arm;  Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted  toward Harry’s wand —   “NO YOU DONT!” roared Harry, and he aimed a kick  at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside,  spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned —   “Get out of the way!” he shouted at Ron and  Hermione.   They didn’t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for  breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching  up her and Ron’s wands. Ron crawled to the four-  poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face  now tinged with green, both hands clutching his  broken leg.   Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin  chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry  walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at  Black’s heart.   “Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing  at Black’s chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise  was rising around Black’s left eye and his nose was  bleeding.   “You killed my parents,” said Harry, his voice shaking  slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.   Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.   “I don’t deny it,” he said very quietly. “But if you knew  the whole story.”   “The whole story?” Harry repeated, a furious  pounding in his ears. “You sold them to Voldemort.  That’s all I need to know.”   “You’ve got to listen to me,” Black said, and there was  a note of urgency in his voice now. “You’ll regret it if  you don’t. ... You don’t understand. ...”   “I understand a lot better than you think,” said Harry,  and his voice shook more than ever. “You never heard  her, did you? My mum ... trying to stop Voldemort  killing me ... and you did that ... you did it. ...”   Before either of them could say another word,  something ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks  leapt onto Black’s chest and settled himself there,  right over Black’s heart. Black blinked and looked  down at the cat.   “Get off,” he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks  off him.   But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black’s robes  and wouldn’t shift. He turned his ugly, squashed face  to Harry and looked up at him with those great yellow  eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his  grip tightening on the wand. So what if he had to kill  the cat too? It was in league with Black. ... If it was  prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that wasn’t  Harry’s business. ... If Black wanted to save it, that  only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for  Harry’s parents. ...   Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it.  Now was the moment to avenge his mother and  father. He was going to kill Black. He had to kill  Black. This was his chance. ...   The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen  there, wand poised, Black staring up at him,  Crookshanks on his chest. Ron’s ragged breathing  came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.   And then came a new sound —   Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor  — someone was moving downstairs.   “WE’RE UP HERE!” Hermione screamed suddenly.  “WE’RE UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK!”   Black made a startled movement that almost  dislodged Crookshanks; Harry gripped his wand  convulsively — Do it nouA said a voice in his head —  but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and  Harry still hadn’t done it.   The door of the room burst open in a shower of red  sparks and Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin  came hurtling into the room, his face bloodless, his  wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron,  lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the  door, to Harry, standing there with his wand coverin Black, and then to Black himself, crumpled and  bleeding at Harry’s feet.   “ ExpelliarmusV’ Lupin shouted.   Harry’s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did  the two Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all  deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black,  who still had Crookshanks lying protectively across  his chest.   Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn’t  done it. His nerve had failed him. Black was going to  be handed back to the dementors.   Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.   “Where is he, Sirius?”   Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn’t understand  what Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He  turned to look at Black again.   Black’s face was quite expressionless. For a few  seconds, he didn’t move at all. Then, very slowly, he  raised his empty hand and pointed straight at Ron.  Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked  bewildered.   “But then ... ,” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so  intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, \"...  why hasn’t he shown himself before now? Unless” —  Lupin’s eyes suddenly widened, as though he was  seeing something beyond Black, something none of  the rest could see, “ — unless he was the one ...  unless you switched . . . without telling me?”   Very slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin’s  face, Black nodded “Professor,” Harry interrupted loudly, “what’s going  on — ?”   But he never finished the question, because what he  saw made his voice die in his throat. Lupin was  lowering his wand, gazing fixedly at Black. The  Professor walked to Black’s side, seized his hand,  pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the  floor, and embraced Black like a brother.   Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of  his stomach.   “I DONT BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed.   Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had  raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin,  wild-eyed. “You — you — ”   “Hermione — ”   “ — you and him!”   “Hermione, calm down — ”   “I didn’t tell anyone!” Hermione shrieked. “I’ve been  covering up for you — ”   “Hermione, listen to me, please!” Lupin shouted. “I  can explain — ”   Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but  with a fresh wave of fury.   “I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice  wavering out of control, “and all the time you’ve been  his friend! “You’re wrong,” said Lupin. “I haven’t been Sirius’s  friend, but I am now — Let me explain. ...”   “NO!” Hermione screamed. “Harry, don’t trust him,  he’s been helping Black get into the castle, he wants  you dead too — he’s a werewolf.”   There was a ringing silence. Everyone’s eyes were now  on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather  pale.   “Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he  said. “Only one out of three, I’m afraid. I have not  been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly  don’t want Harry dead. ...” An odd shiver passed over  his face. “But I won’t deny that I am a werewolf.”   Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back  with a whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him,  looking concerned, but Ron gasped,   “Get away from me, werewolf”   Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he  turned to Hermione and said, “How long have you  known?”   “Ages,” Hermione whispered. “Since I did Professor  Snape’s essay. ...”   “He’ll be delighted,” said Lupin coolly. “He assigned  that essay hoping someone would realize what my  symptoms meant. ... Did you check the lunar chart  and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or  did you realize that the boggart changed into the  moon when it saw me?”   “Both,” Hermione said quietly Lupin forced a laugh.   “You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met,  Hermione.”   “I’m not,” Hermione whispered. “If I’d been a bit  cleverer, I’d have told everyone what you are!”   “But they already know,” said Lupin. “At least, the  staff do.”   “Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a  werewolf?” Ron gasped. “Is he mad?”   “Some of the staff thought so,” said Lupin. “He had to  work very hard to convince certain teachers that I’m  trustworthy — ”   “AND HE WAS WRONG!” Harry yelled. “YOU VE BEEN  HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!” He was pointing at  Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed  and sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking  hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped  onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of  them, dragging his leg.   “I have not been helping Sirius,” said Lupin. “If you’ll  give me a chance, I’ll explain. Look — ”   He separated Harry’s, Ron’s and Hermione’s wands  and threw each back to its owner; Harry caught his,  stunned.   “There,” said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into  his belt. “You’re armed, we’re not. Now will you  listen?”   Harry didn’t know what to think. Was it a trick “If you haven’t been helping him,” he said, with a  furious glance at Black, “how did you know he was  here? “The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in  my office examining it — ”   “You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously.   “Of course I know how to work it,” said Lupin, waving  his hand impatiently. “I helped write it. I’m Moony —  that was my friends’ nickname for me at school.”   “You wrote — ?”   “The important thing is, I was watching it carefully  this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron,  and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to  visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I  was right, wasn’t I?”   He had started to pace up and down, looking at them.  Little patches of dust rose at his feet.   “You might have been wearing your father’s old cloak,  Harry — ”   “How d’you know about the cloak?”   “The number of times I saw James disappearing  under it... ,” said Lupin, waving an impatient hand  again. “The point is, even if you’re wearing an  Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s  Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter  Hagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid,  and set off back toward the castle. But you were now  accompanied by somebody else.”   “What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t! “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Lupin, still pacing,  and ignoring Harry’s interruption. “I thought the map  must be malfunctioning. How could he be with you?”   “No one was with us!” said Harry.   “And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you,  labeled Sirius Black. ... I saw him collide with you; I  watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping  Willow — ”   “One of us!” Ron said angrily.   “No, Ron,” said Lupin. “Two of you.”   He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.   “Do you think I could have a look at the rat?” he said  evenly.   “What?” said Ron. “What’s Scabbers got to do with  it? “Everything,” said Lupin. “Could I see him, please?”   Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes.  Scabbers emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to  seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping.  Crookshanks stood up on Black’s leg and made a soft  hissing noise.   Lupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding  his breath as he gazed intently at Scabbers.   “What?” Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to  him, looking scared. “What’s my rat got to do with  anything?”   “That’s not a rat,” croaked Sirius Black suddenly “What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat — ”   “No, he’s not,” said Lupin quietly. “He’s a wizard.”   “An Animagus,” said Black, “by the name of Peter  Pettigrew. MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this  statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry  was thinking.   “You’re both mental.”   “Ridiculous!” said Hermione faintly.   “Peter Pettigrew’s dead!” said Harry. “He killed him  twelve years ago!” He pointed at Black, whose face  twitched convulsively.   “I meant to,” he growled, his yellow teeth bared, “but  little Peter got the better of me ... not this time,  though!”   And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black  lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black’s  weight fell on his broken leg “Sirius, NO!” Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards  and dragging Black away from Ron again, “WAIT! You  can’t do it just like that — they need to understand —  we’ve got to explain — ”   “We can explain afterwards!” snarled Black, trying to  throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as  it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a  piglet, scratching Ron’s face and neck as he tried to  escape.   “They’ve — got — a — right — to — know —  everything!” Lupin panted, still trying to restrain  Black. “Ron’s kept him as a pet! There are parts of it  even I don’t understand! And Harry — you owe Harry  the truth, Sirius!”   Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes  were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly  under Ron’s bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands.   “All right, then,” Black said, without taking his eyes  off the rat. “Tell them whatever you like. But make it  quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was  imprisoned for. ...”   “You’re nutters, both of you,” said Ron shakily,  looking round at Harry and Hermione for support.   “I’ve had enough of this. I’m off.”   He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but  Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers.   “You’re going to hear me out, Ron,” he said quietly.  “Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.”   “HE’S NOT PETER, HE’S SCABBERS!” Ron yelled,  trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but  Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed an overbalanced, and Harry caught him and pushed him  back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry  turned to Lupin.   “There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,” he  said. “A whole street full of them ...”   “They didn’t see what they thought they saw!” said  Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in  Ron’s hands.   “Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,” said Lupin,  nodding. “I believed it myself — until I saw the map  tonight. Because the Marauder’s map never lies ...  Peter’s alive. Ron’s holding him, Harry.”   Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met,  they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out  of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever.  How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban  must have unhinged Black after all — but why was  Lupin playing along with him?   Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm  sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin  to talk sensibly.   “But Professor Lupin ... Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew  ... it just can’t be true, you know it can’t ...”   “Why can’t it be true?” Lupin said calmly, as though  they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted  a problem in an experiment with grindylows.   “Because . . . because people would know if Peter  Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in  class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them  up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic  keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can becom animals; there’s a register showing what animal they  become, and their markings and things ... and I went  and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register,  and there have been only seven Animagi this century,  and Pettigrew’s name wasn’t on the list — ”   Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the  effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin  started to laugh. “Right again, Hermione!” he said.  “But the Ministry never knew that there used to be  three unregistered Animagi running around  Hogwarts.”   “If you’re going to tell them the story, get a move on,  Remus,” snarled Black, who was still watching  Scabbers’s every desperate move. “I’ve waited twelve  years, I’m not going to wait much longer.”   “All right ... but you’ll need to help me, Sirius,” said  Lupin, “I only know how it began ...”   Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind  him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord.  All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward  it and looked out into the landing.   “No one there ...”   “This place is haunted!” said Ron.   “It’s not,” said Lupin, still looking at the door in a  puzzled way. “The Shrieking Shack was never  haunted. ... The screams and howls the villagers used  to hear were made by me.”   He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought  for a moment, then said, “That’s where all of this  starts — with my becoming a werewolf. None of thi could have happened if I hadn’t been bitten ... and if I  hadn’t been so foolhardy. ...”   He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt,  but Hermione said, “Shh!” She was watching Lupin  very intently.   “I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My  parents tried everything, but in those days there was  no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been  making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me  safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week  preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I  transform. ... I am able to curl up in my office, a  harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.   “Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered,  however, I became a fully fledged monster once a  month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to  come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren’t likely to  want their children exposed to me.   “But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he  was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took  certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn’t  come to school. ...” Lupin sighed, and looked directly  at Harry. “I told you, months ago, that the Whomping  Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The  truth is that it was planted because I came to  Hogwarts. This house” — Lupin looked miserably  around the room, — “the tunnel that leads to it —  they were built for my use. Once a month, I was  smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to  transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth  to stop anyone coming across me while I was  dangerous.”   Harry couldn’t see where this story was going, but he  was listening raptly all the same. The only soun apart from Lupin’s voice was Scabbers’s frightened  squeaking “My transformations in those days were — were  terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I  was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and  scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the  noise and the screaming and thought they were  hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore  encouraged the rumor. . . . Even now, when the house  has been silent for years, the villagers don’t dare  approach it. ...   “But apart from my transformations, I was happier  than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever,  I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black ...   Peter Pettigrew ... and, of course, your father, Harry  — James Potter.   “Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that  I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of  stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had  to go home to see her. ... I was terrified they would  desert me the moment they found out what I was. But  of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the  truth. ...   “And they didn’t desert me at all. Instead, they did  something for me that would make my  transformations not only bearable, but the best times  of my life. They became Animagi.”   “My dad too?” said Harry, astounded.   “Yes, indeed,” said Lupin. “It took them the best part  of three years to work out how to do it. Your father  and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the  school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus  transformation can go horribly wrong — one reaso the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting  to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from  James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they  managed it. They could each turn into a different  animal at will.”   “But how did that help you?” said Hermione,  sounding puzzled.   “They couldn’t keep me company as humans, so they  kept me company as animals,” said Lupin. “A  werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out  of the castle every month under James’s Invisibility  Cloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest,  could slip beneath the Willow’s attacking branches  and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then  slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their  influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still  wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while  I was with them.”   “Hurry up, Remus,” snarled Black, who was still  watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on  his face.   “I’m getting there, Sirius, I’m getting there ... well,  highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that  we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the  Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and  the village by night. Sirius and James transformed  into such large animals, they were able to keep a  werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts  students ever found out more about the Hogwarts  grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. ... And that’s  how we came to write the Marauder’s Map, and sign it  with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is  Wormtail. James was Prongs. “What sort of animal — ?” Harry began, but Hermione  cut him off.   “That was still really dangerous! Running around in  the dark with a werewolf! What if you’d given the  others the slip, and bitten somebody?”   “A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily.  “And there were near misses, many of them. We  laughed about them afterwards. We were young,  thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.”   “I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore’s  trust, of course ... he had admitted me to Hogwarts  when no other headmaster would have done so, and  he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set  down for my own and others’ safety. He never knew I  had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi  illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty  feelings every time we sat down to plan our next  month’s adventure. And I haven’t changed ...”   Lupin’s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust  in his voice. “All this year, I have been battling with  myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore  that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn’t do it. Why?  Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant  admitting that I’d betrayed his trust while I was at  school, admitting that I’d led others along with me ...  and Dumbledore’s trust has meant everything to me.  He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a  job when I have been shunned all my adult life,  unable to find paid work because of what I am. And  so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the  school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort,  that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it . . .  so, in a way, Snape’s been right about me all along. “Snape?” said Black harshly, taking his eyes off  Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up  at Lupin. “What’s Snape got to do with it?”   “He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin heavily. “He’s teaching  here as well.” He looked up at Harry, Ron, and  Hermione.   “Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought  very hard against my appointment to the Defense  Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling  Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He  has his reasons ... you see, Sirius here played a trick  on him which nearly killed him, a trick which  involved me — ”   Black made a derisive noise.   “It served him right,” he sneered. “Sneaking around,  trying to find out what we were up to . . . hoping he  could get us expelled. ...”   “Severus was very interested in where I went every  month.” Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “We  were in the same year, you know, and we — er —  didn’t like each other very much. He especially  disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James’s talent on  the Quidditch field . . . anyway Snape had seen me  crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one  evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow  to transform. Sirius thought it would be — er —  amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the  knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he’d be  able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it  — if he’d got as far as this house, he’d have met a  fully grown werewolf — but your father, who’d heard  what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled  him back, at great risk to his life . . . Snape glimpsed  me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He wa forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from  that time on he knew what I was. ...”   “So that’s why Snape doesn’t like you,” said Harry  slowly, “because he thought you were in on the joke?”   “That’s right,” sneered a cold voice from the wall  behind Lupin.   Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak,  his wand pointing directly at Lupin THE SERVANT OF LORD  Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt  as though he’d received a huge electric shock.   “I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,”  said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep  this wand pointing directly at Lupin’s chest. “Very  useful, Potter, I thank you. ...”   Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of  suppressed triumph. “You’re wondering, perhaps,  how I knew you were here?” he said, his eyes  glittering. “I’ve just been to your office, Lupin. You  forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful  along. And very lucky I did ... lucky for me, I mean.  Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at  it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running  along this passageway and out of sight.”   “Severus — ” Lupin began, but Snape overrode him “I’ve told the headmaster again and again that you’re  helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin,  and here’s the proof. Not even I dreamed you would  have the nerve to use this old place as your hideou “Severus, you’re making a mistake,” said Lupin  urgently. “You haven’t heard everything — I can  explain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry — ”   “Two more for Azkaban tonight,” said Snape, his eyes  now gleaming fanatically. “I shall be interested to see  how Dumbledore takes this. ... He was quite  convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin ... a  tame werewolf — ”   “You fool,” said Lupin softly. “Is a schoolboy grudge  worth putting an innocent man back inside  Azkaban?”   BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of  Snape’s wand and twisted themselves around Lupin’s  mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell  to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage,   Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his  wand straight between Black’s eyes.   “Give me a reason,” he whispered. “Give me a reason  to do it, and I swear I will.”   Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to  say which face showed more hatred.   Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do  or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and  Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still  fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers.  Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward  Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, “Professo Snape — it — it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve  got to say, w — would it?”   “Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension  from this school,” Snape spat. “You, Potter, and  Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a  convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your  life, hold your tongue.”   “But if — if there was a mistake — ”   “KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted,  looking suddenly quite deranged. “DONT TALK  ABOUT WHAT YOU DONT UNDERSTAND!” A few  sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was  still pointed at Black’s face. Hermione fell silent.   “Vengeance is very sweet,” Snape breathed at Black.  “How I hoped I would be the one to catch you. ...”   “The joke’s on you again, Severus,” Black snarled. “As  long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle” — he  jerked his head at Ron — “I’ll come quietly. ...”   “Up to the castle?” said Snape silkily. “I don’t think  we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the  dementors once we get out of the Willow. They’ll be  very pleased to see you, Black ... pleased enough to  give you a little kiss, I daresay. ...”   What little color there was in Black’s face left it.   “You — you’ve got to hear me out,” he croaked. “The  rat — look at the rat — ”   But there was a mad glint in Snape ’s eyes that Harry  had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason “Come on, all of you,” he said. He clicked his fingers,  and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to  his hands. “Ill drag the werewolf. Perhaps the  dementors will have a kiss for him too — ”   Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed  the room in three strides and blocked the door.   “Get out of the way, Potter, you’re in enough trouble  already,” snarled Snape. “If I hadn’t been here to save  your skin — ”   “Professor Lupin could have killed me about a  hundred times this year,” Harry said. “I’ve been alone  with him loads of times, having defense lessons  against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why  didn’t he just finish me off then?”   “Don’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf’s mind  works,” hissed Snape. “Get out of the way, Potter.”   “YOU’RE PATHETIC!” Harry yelled. “JUST BECAUSE  THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU  WONT EVEN LISTEN — ”   “SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!”  Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. “Like  father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck;  you should be thanking me on bended knee! You  would have been well served if he’d killed you! You’d  have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you  might be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way,  or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!”   Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before  Snape could take even one step toward him, he had  raised his wand “ Expelliarmus\\” he yelled — except that his wasn’t the  only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made  the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his  feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to  the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair.  He had been knocked out.   Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had  tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment.  Snape ’s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the  bed next to Crookshanks.   “You shouldn’t have done that,” said Black, looking at  Harry. “You should have left him to me. ...”   Harry avoided Black’s eyes. He wasn’t sure, even now,  that he’d done the right thing.   “We attacked a teacher. ... We attacked a teacher ... ,”  Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape  with frightened eyes. “Oh, we’re going to be in so  much trouble — ”   Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent  down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up,  rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them.   “Thank you, Harry,” he said.   “I’m still not saying I believe you,” he told Lupin.   “Then it’s time we offered you some proof,” said  Lupin. “You, boy — give me Peter, please. Now.”   Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.   “Come off it,” he said weakly. “Are you trying to say  he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on  Scabbers ? I mean ...” He looked up at Harry an Hermione for support, “Okay, say Pettigrew could  turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how’s he  supposed to know which one he’s after if he was  locked up in Azkaban?”   “You know, Sirius, that’s a fair question,” said Lupin,  turning to Black and frowning slightly. “How did you  find out where he was?”   Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes  and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he  smoothed flat and held out to show the others.   It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had  appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer,  and there, on Ron’s shoulder, was Scabbers.   “How did you get this?” Lupin asked Black,  thunderstruck.   “Fudge,” said Black. “When he came to inspect  Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there  was Peter, on the front page ... on this boy’s shoulder.  ... I knew him at once . . . how many times had I seen  him transform? And the caption said the boy would  be going back to Hogwarts ... to where Harry was. ...”   “My God,” said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to  the picture in the paper and back again. “His front  paw ...”   “What about it?” said Ron defiantly.   “He’s got a toe missing,” said Black.   “Of course,” Lupin breathed. “So simple ... so brilliant  ... he cut it off himself? “Just before he transformed,” said Black. “When I  cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear  that I’d betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could  curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand  behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of  himself — and sped down into the sewer with the  other rats. ...”   “Didn’t you ever hear, Ron?” said Lupin. “The biggest  bit of Peter they found was his finger.”   “Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat  or something! He’s been in my family for ages, right  “Twelve years, in fact,” said Lupin. “Didn’t you ever  wonder why he was living so long?”   “We — we’ve been taking good care of him!” said Ron.   “Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?”  said Lupin. “I’d guess he’s been losing weight ever  since he heard Sirius was on the loose again. ...”   “He’s been scared of that mad cat!” said Ron, nodding  toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the  bed.   But that wasn’t right, Harry thought suddenly. ...  Scabbers had been looking ill before he met  Crookshanks . . . ever since Ron’s return from Egypt . . .  since the time when Black had escaped. ...   “This cat isn’t mad,” said Black hoarsely. He reached  out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks ’s fluffy  head. “He’s the most intelligent of his kind I’ve ever  met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away.  And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a  while before he trusted me. ... Finally, I managed t communicate to him what I was after, and he’s been  helping me. ... “What do you mean?” breathed Hermione.   “He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn’t ... so he  stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me. ...   As I understand it, he took them from a boy’s bedside  table. ...”   Harry’s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight  of what he was hearing. It was absurd . . . and yet . . .   “But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for  it. ...” croaked Black. “This cat — Crookshanks, did  you call him? — told me Peter had left blood on the  sheets. ... I supposed he bit himself. ... Well, faking  his own death had worked once. ...”   These words jolted Harry to his senses.   “And why did he fake his death?” he said furiously.  “Because he knew you were about to kill him like you  killed my parents!”   “No,” said Lupin, “Harry — ”   “And now you’ve come to finish him off!”   “Yes, I have,” said Black, with an evil look at  Scabbers.   “Then I should’ve let Snape take you!” Harry shouted.   “Harry,” said Lupin hurriedly, “don’t you see? All this  time we’ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and  Peter tracked him down — but it was the other way  around, don’t you see? Peter betrayed your mother  and father — Sirius tracked Peter down —  “THAT’S NOT TRUE!” Harry yelled. “HE WAS THEIR  SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU  TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!”   He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly;  the sunken eyes were suddenly overbright.   “Harry ... I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I  persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the  last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret-  Keeper instead of me. ... I’m to blame, I know it. ...  The night they died, I’d arranged to check on Peter,  make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his  hiding place, he’d gone. Yet there was no sign of a  struggle. It didn’t feel right. I was scared. I set out for  your parents’ house straight away. And when I saw  their house, destroyed, and their bodies ... I realized  what Peter must’ve done ... what I’d done. ...”   His voice broke. He turned away.   “Enough of this,” said Lupin, and there was a steely  note in his voice Harry had never heard before.  “There’s one certain way to prove what really  happened. Ron, give me that rat”   “What are you going to do with him if I give him to  you?” Ron asked Lupin tensely.   “Force him to show himself,” said Lupin. “If he really  is a rat, it won’t hurt him.”   Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out  Scabbers and Lupin took him. Scabbers began to  squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his  tiny black eyes bulging in his head.   “Ready, Sirius?” said Lupin Black had already retrieved Snape’s wand from the  bed. He approached Lupin and the struggling rat, and  his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his  face.   “Together?” he said quietly.   “I think so,” said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in  one hand and his wand in the other. “On the count of  three. One — two — THREE!”   A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands;  for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his  small gray form twisting madly — Ron yelled — the  rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding  flash of light and then —   It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing  tree. A head was shooting upward from the ground;  limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a man was  standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and  wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and  snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was  standing up.   He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry  and Hermione. His thin, colorless hair was unkempt  and there was a large bald patch on top. He had the  shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a  lot of weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby,  almost like Scabbers ’s fur, and something of the rat  lingered around his pointed nose and his very small,  watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his  breathing fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to  the door and back again.   “Well, hello, Peter,” said Lupin pleasantly, as though  rats frequently erupted into old school friends around  him. “Long time, no see. “S — Sirius ... R — Remus ...” Even Pettigrew’s voice  was squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door.  “My friends ... my old friends ...”   Black’s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around  the wrist, gave him a warning look, then turned again  to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual.   “We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what  happened the night Lily and James died. You might  have missed the finer points while you were  squeaking around down there on the bed — ”   “Remus,” gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see  beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face, “you  don’t believe him, do you... ? He tried to kill me,  Remus. ...”   “So we’ve heard,” said Lupin, more coldly. “I’d like to  clear up one or two little matters with you, Peter, if  you’d be so — ”   “He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew  squeaked suddenly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw  that he used his middle finger, because his index was  missing. “He killed Lily and James and now he’s going  to kill me too. ... You’ve got to help me, Remus. ...”   Black’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he  stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes.   “No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a  few things out,” said Lupin.   “Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking  wildly about him once more, eyes taking in the  boarded windows and, again, the only door. “I knew  he’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for me! I’ve  been waiting for this for twelve years! “You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?”  said Lupin, his brow furrowed. “When nobody has  ever done it before?”   “He’s got dark powers the rest of us can only dream  of!” Pettigrew shouted shrilly. “How else did he get out  of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  taught him a few tricks!”   Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh  that filled the whole room.   “Voldemort, teach me tricks?” he said.   Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a  whip at him.   “What, scared to hear your old master’s name?” said  Black. “I don’t blame you, Peter. His lot aren’t very  happy with you, are they?”   “Don’t know what you mean, Sirius — ” muttered  Pettigrew, his breathing faster than ever. His whole  face was shining with sweat now.   “You haven’t been hiding from me for twelve years,”  said Black. “You’ve been hiding from Voldemort’s old  supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. ... They  all think you’re dead, or you’d have to answer to  them. ... I’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things  in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-  crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the  Potters’ on your information ... and Voldemort met his  downfall there. And not all Voldemort’s supporters  ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty  out here, biding their time, pretending they’ve seen  the error of their ways. ... If they ever got wind that  you were still alive, Peter —  “Don’t know ... what you’re talking about... said  Pettigrew again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his  face on his sleeve and looked up at Lupin. “You don’t  believe this — this madness, Remus — ”   “I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in  understanding why an innocent man would want to  spend twelve years as a rat,” said Lupin evenly.   “Innocent, but scared!” squealed Pettigrew. “If  Voldemort’s supporters were after me, it was because  I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy,  Sirius Black!”   Black’s face contorted.   “How dare you,” he growled, sounding suddenly like  the bear-sized dog he had been. “I, a spy for  Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people who  were stronger and more powerful than myself? But  you, Peter — I’ll never understand why I didn’t see  you were the spy from the start. You always liked big  friends who’d look after you, didn’t you? It used to be  us ... me and Remus ... and James. ...”   Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting  for breath.   “Me, a spy ... must be out of your mind ... never ...  don’t know how you can say such a — ”   “Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper  because I suggested it,” Black hissed, so venomously  that Pettigrew took a step backward. “I thought it was  the perfect plan ... a bluff. ... Voldemort would be  sure to come after me, would never dream they’d use  a weak, talentless thing like you. ... It must have been  the finest moment of your miserable life, telling  Voldemort you could hand him the Potters. Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught  words like “far-fetched” and “lunacy,” but he couldn’t  help paying more attention to the ashen color of  Pettigrew’s face and the way his eyes continued to  dart toward the windows and door.   “Professor Lupin?” said Hermione timidly. “Can — can  I say something?”   “Certainly, Hermione,” said Lupin courteously.   “Well — Scabbers — I mean, this — this man — he’s  been sleeping in Harry’s dormitory for three years. If  he’s working for You-Know-Who, how come he never  tried to hurt Harry before now?”   “There!” said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with  his maimed hand. “Thank you! You see, Remus? I  have never hurt a hair of Harry’s head! Why should  I?”   “I’ll tell you why,” said Black. “Because you never did  anything for anyone unless you could see what was in  it for you. Voldemort’s been in hiding for fifteen years,  they say he’s half dead. You weren’t about to commit  murder right under Albus Dumbledore’s nose, for a  wreck of a wizard who’d lost all of his power, were  you? You’d want to be quite sure he was the biggest  bully in the playground before you went back to him,  wouldn’t you? Why else did you find a wizard family  to take you in? Keeping an ear out for news, weren’t  you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained  strength, and it was safe to rejoin him. ...”   Pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several  times. He seemed to have lost the ability to talk.   “Er — Mr. Black — Sirius?” said Hermione Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared  at Hermione as though he had never seen anything  quite like her.   “If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get  out of Azkaban, if you didn’t use Dark Magic?”   “Thank you!” gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at  her. “Exactly! Precisely what I — ”   But Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was  frowning slightly at Hermione, but not as though he  were annoyed with her. He seemed to be pondering  his answer.   “I don’t know how I did it,” he said slowly. “I think the  only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was  innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the  dementors couldn’t suck it out of me ... but it kept me  sane and knowing who I am . . . helped me keep my  powers ... so when it all became . . . too much ... I  could transform in my cell . . . become a dog.  Dementors can’t see, you know. ...” He swallowed.  “They feel their way toward people by feeding off their  emotions. ... They could tell that my feelings were less  — less human, less complex when I was a dog ... but  they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind  like everyone else in there, so it didn’t trouble them.  But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of  driving them away from me without a wand. ...   “But then I saw Peter in that picture ... I realized he  was at Hogwarts with Harry . . . perfectly positioned to  act, if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side  was gathering strength again. ...”   Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing  noiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as  though hypnotized \"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of  allies ... and to deliver the last Potter to them. If he  gave them Harry, who’d dare say he’d betrayed Lord  Voldemort? He’d be welcomed back with honors. ...   “So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one  who knew Peter was still alive. ...”   Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs.  Weasley. “The guards say he’s been talking in his  sleep ... always the same words ... ‘He’s at Hog warts. “It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and  the dementors couldn’t destroy it. ... It wasn’t a  happy feeling ... it was an obsession . . . but it gave me  strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night when they  opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as  a dog. ... It’s so much harder for them to sense  animal emotions that they were confused. ... I was  thin, very thin . . . thin enough to slip through the  bars. ... I swam as a dog back to the mainland. ... I  journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts  grounds as a dog. I’ve been living in the forest ever  since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of  course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry. ...”   He looked at Harry, who did not look away.   “Believe me,” croaked Black. “Believe me, Harry. I  never betrayed James and Lily. I would have died  before I betrayed them.”   And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight  to speak, he nodded.   “No! Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry’s  nod had been his own death sentence. He shuffled  forward on his knees, groveling, his hands clasped in  front of him as though praying.   “Sirius — it’s me ... it’s Peter ... your friend ... you  wouldn’t ...”   Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.   “There’s enough filth on my robes without you  touching them,” said Black.   “Remus!” Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin  instead, writhing imploringly in front of him. “You  don’t believe this ... wouldn’t Sirius have told you  they’d changed the plan?”   “Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,” said Lupin. “I  assume that’s why you didn’t tell me, Sirius?” he said  casually over Pettigrew’s head.   “Forgive me, Remus,” said Black.   “Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,” said Lupin, who was  now rolling up his sleeves. “And will you, in turn,  forgive me for believing you were the spy?”   “Of course,” said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted  across his gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his  sleeves. “Shall we kill him together?”   “Yes, I think so,” said Lupin grimly.   “You wouldn’t ... you won’t... ,” gasped Pettigrew. And  he scrambled around to Ron “Ron ... haven’t I been a good friend ... a good pet?   You won’t let them kill me, Ron, will you ... you’re on  my side, aren’t you?”   But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost  revulsion.   “I let you sleep in my bed\\” he said.   “Kind boy ... kind master ...” Pettigrew crawled toward  Ron, “you won’t let them do it. ... I was your rat. ... I  was a good pet. ...”   “If you made a better rat than a human, it’s not much  to boast about, Peter,” said Black harshly. Ron, going  still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of  Pettigrew’s reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees,  staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione’s  robes.   “Sweet girl ... clever girl ... you — you won’t let them.  ... Help me. ...”   Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew’s  clutching hands and backed away against the wall,  looking horrified.   Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned  his head slowly toward Harry.   “Harry ... Harry ... you look just like your father ...  just like him. ...”   “HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?” roared Black.  “HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW DARE YOU TALK  ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?”   “Harry,” whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him,  hands outstretched. “Harry, James wouldn’t hav wanted me killed. ... James would have understood,  Harry ... he would have shown me mercy. ... Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized  Pettigrew’s shoulders, and threw him backward onto  the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror, staring  up at them.   “You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,” said Black,  who was shaking too. “Do you deny it?”   Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch,  like an oversized, balding baby, cowering on the floor.   “Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark  Lord . . . you have no idea ... he has weapons you can’t  imagine. ... I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave  like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to  happen. ... He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me  “DONT LIE!” bellowed Black. “YOU’D BEEN PASSING  INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY  AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!”   “He — he was taking over everywhere!” gasped  Pettigrew. “Wh — what was there to be gained by  refusing him?”   “What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil  wizard who has ever existed?” said Black, with a  terribly fury in his face. “Only innocent lives, Peter!”   “You don’t understand!” whined Pettigrew. “He would  have killed me, Sirius!”   “THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!” roared Black.  “DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS, AS  WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU! Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands  raised.   “You should have realized,” said Lupin quietly, “if  Voldemort didn’t kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.”   Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned  to the wall.   “NO!” Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in  front of Pettigrew, facing the wands. “You can’t kill  him,” he said breathlessly. “You can’t.”   Black and Lupin both looked staggered.   “Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no  parents,” Black snarled. “This cringing bit of filth  would have seen you die too, without turning a hair.  You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more to  him than your whole family.”   “I know,” Harry panted. “We’ll take him up to the  castle. We’ll hand him over to the dementors. ... He  can go to Azkaban ... but don’t kill him.”   “Harry!” gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms  around Harry’s knees. “You — thank you — it’s more  than I deserve — thank you — ”   “Get off me,” Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew’s hands  off him in disgust. “I’m not doing this for you. I’m  doing it because — I don’t reckon my dad would’ve  wanted them to become killers — just for you.”   No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew,  whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched  his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at each  other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their  wands “You’re the only person who has the right to decide,  Harry,” said Black. “But think ... think what he did “He can go to Azkaban,” Harry repeated. “If anyone  deserves that place, he does. ...”   Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him.   “Very well,” said Lupin. “Stand aside, Harry.”   Harry hesitated.   “I’m going to tie him up,” said Lupin. “That’s all, I  swear.”   Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from  Lupin’s wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew  was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged.   “But if you transform, Peter,” growled Black, his own  wand pointing at Pettigrew too, “we will kill you. You  agree, Harry?”   Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor  and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.   “Right,” said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. “Ron, I  can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey,  so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we  can get you to the hospital wing.”   He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg  with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages  spun up Ron’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.  Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight  gingerly on the leg and didn’t wince.   “That’s better,” he said. “Thanks. “What about Professor Snape?” said Hermione in a  small voice, looking down at Snape’s prone figure “There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said  Lupin, bending over Snape and checking his pulse.  “You were just a little — overenthusiastic. Still out  cold. Er — perhaps it will be best if we don’t revive  him until we’re safely back in the castle. We can take  him like this. ...”   He muttered, “Mobilicorpus.” As though invisible  strings were tied to Snape’s wrists, neck, and knees,  he was pulled into a standing position, head still  lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung  a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling.  Lupin picked up the Invisibility Cloak and tucked it  safely into his pocket.   “And two of us should be chained to this,” said Black,  nudging Pettigrew with his toe. “Just to make sure.”   “I’ll do it,” said Lupin.   “And me,” said Ron savagely, limping forward.   Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon  Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to  Lupin’s right, right arm to Ron’s left. Ron’s face was  set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers’s true identity  as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the  bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush  tail held jauntily high THE DEMENTOR’S Harry had never been part of a stranger group.  Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin,  Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants in  a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting  creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they  descended, held up by his own wand, which was  being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione  brought up the rear.   Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin,  Pettigrew, and Ron had to turn sideways to manage  it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand.  Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the  tunnel in single file. Crookshanks was still in the  lead. Harry went right after Black, who was still  making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept  bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry  had the impression Black was making no effort to  prevent this “You know what this means?” Black said abruptly to  Harry as they made their slow progress along the  tunnel. “Turning Pettigrew in?”   “You’re free,” said Harry.   “Yes ... ,” said Black. “But I’m also — I don’t know if  anyone ever told you — I’m your godfather.”   “Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry.   “Well ... your parents appointed me your guardian,”  said Black stiffly. “If anything happened to them ...”   Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he  meant?   “I’ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with  your aunt and uncle,” said Black. “But ... well ...  think about it. Once my name’s cleared ... if you  wanted a ... a different home ...”   Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry’s  stomach.   “What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking  his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling.  “Leave the Dursleys?”   “Of course, I thought you wouldn’t want to,” said  Black quickly. “I understand, I just thought I’d — ”   “Are you insane?” said Harry, his voice easily as  croaky as Black’s. “Of course I want to leave the  Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move  in? Black turned right around to look at him; Snape’s  head was scraping the ceiling but Black didn’t seem  to care.   “You want to?” he said. “You mean it?”   “Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry.   Black’s gaunt face broke into the first true smile  Harry had seen upon it. The difference it made was  startling, as though a person ten years younger were  shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he  was recognizable as the man who had laughed at  Harry’s parents’ wedding.   They did not speak again until they had reached the  end of the tunnel. Crookshanks darted up first; he  had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the  trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered  upward without any sound of savaging branches.   Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood  back for Harry and Hermione to pass. At last, all of  them were out.   The grounds were very dark now; the only light came  from the distant windows of the castle. Without a  word, they set off. Pettigrew was still wheezing and  occasionally whimpering. Harry’s mind was buzzing.  He was going to leave the Dursleys. He was going to  live with Sirius Black, his parents’ best friend. ... He  felt dazed. ... What would happen when he told the  Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they’d  seen on television... !   “One wrong move, Peter,” said Lupin threateningly  ahead. His wand was still pointed sideways at  Pettigrew’s chest Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle  lights growing slowly larger. Snape was still drifting  weirdly ahead of Black, his chin bumping on his  chest. And then —   A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on  the ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight.   Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who  had stopped abruptly. Black froze. He flung out one  arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.   Harry could see Lupin’s silhouette. He had gone rigid.  Then his limbs began to shake.   “Oh, my — ” Hermione gasped. “He didn’t take his  potion tonight! He’s not safe!”   “Run,” Black whispered. “Run. Now.”   But Harry couldn’t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew  and Lupin. He leapt forward but Black caught him  around the chest and threw him back.   “Leave it to me — RUN!”   There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin’s head was  lengthening. So was his body. His shoulders were  hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and  hands, which were curling into clawed paws.  Crookshanks’s hair was on end again; he was backing  away —   As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius  disappeared from Harry’s side. He had transformed.  The enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward. As the  werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding  it, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled i backward, away from Ron and Pettigrew. They were  locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other —   Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon  the battle to notice anything else. It was Hermione’s  scream that alerted him —   Pettigrew had dived for Lupin’s dropped wand. Ron,  unsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang,  a burst of light — and Ron lay motionless on the  ground. Another bang — Crookshanks flew into the  air and back to the earth in a heap.   “ ExpelliarmusV’ Harry yelled, pointing his own wand  at Pettigrew; Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and  out of sight. “Stay where you are!” Harry shouted,  running forward.   Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his  bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron’s  outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the  grass.   There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned  to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into  the forest —   “Sirius, he’s gone, Pettigrew transformed!” Harry  yelled.   Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his  muzzle and back, but at Harry’s words he scrambled  up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws  faded to silence as he pounded away across the  grounds.   Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron “What did he do to him?” Hermione whispered. Ron’s  eyes were only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he  was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing,  but he didn’t seem to recognize them.   “I don’t know. ...”   Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin  both gone . . . they had no one but Snape for company,  still hanging, unconscious, in midair.   “We’d better get them up to the castle and tell  someone,” said Harry, pushing his hair out of his  eyes, trying to think straight. Come — ”   But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they  heard a yelping, a whining: a dog in pain. ...   “Sirius,” Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.   He had a moment’s indecision, but there was nothing  they could do for Ron at the moment, and by the  sound of it, Black was in trouble —   Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him.   The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground  near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward it, and  Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing  what it must mean —   The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the  lakeshore, they saw why — Sirius had turned back  into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands  over his head.   “iVooo,” he moaned. “Noooo ... please. ...”   And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a  hundred of them, gliding in a black mass around th lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy  cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure  his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness  on every side; they were encircling them. ...   “Hermione, think of something happy!” Harry yelled,  raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear  his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint  screaming that had started inside it —   I’m going to live with my godfather. I’m leaving the  Dursleys.   He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black,  and began to chant: “Expecto patronum). Expecto  patronum).”   Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless  on the ground, pale as death.   Hell be all right. I’m going to go and live with him.   “Expecto patronum). Hermione, help me! Expecto  patronum).”   “Expecto — ” Hermione whispered, “expecto — expect But she couldn’t do it. The dementors were closing in,  barely ten feet from them. They formed a solid wall  around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer “EXPECTO PATRONUM” Harry yelled, trying to blot  the screaming from his ears. “EXPECTO PATRONUM.”   A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered  like mist before him. At the same moment, Harry fel Hermione collapse next to him. He was alone ...  completely alone. ...   “Expecto — expecto patronum — ”   Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was  clouding his eyes. With a huge effort, he fought to  remember — Sirius was innocent — innocent — We’ll  be okay — I’m going to live with him —   “ Expecto patronum J” he gasped.   By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a  dementor halt, very close to him. It couldn’t walk  through the cloud of silver mist Harry had conjured.   A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It  made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus  aside.   “No — no — ” Harry gasped. “He’s innocent ... expecto  — expecto patronum — ”   He could feel them watching him, hear their rattling  breath like an evil wind around him. The nearest  dementor seemed to be considering him. Then it  raised both its rotting hands — and lowered its hood.   Where there should have been eyes, there was only  thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty  sockets. But there was a mouth ... a gaping,  shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a  death rattle.   A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn’t  move or speak. His Patronus flickered and died.   White fog was blinding him. He had to fight ... expecto  patronum ... he couldn’t see ... and in the distance, he  heard the familiar screaming . . . expecto patronum . .  he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm ...  they weren’t going to take him. ...   But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly  attached themselves around Harry’s neck. They were  forcing his face upward. ... He could feel its breath. ...  It was going to get rid of him first. ... He could feel its  putrid breath. . . . His mother was screaming in his  ears. ... She was going to be the last thing he ever  heard —   And then, through the fog that was drowning him, he  thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and  brighter. ... He felt himself fall forward onto the grass.  ... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,  Harry opened his eyes. The dementor must have  released him. The blinding light was illuminating the  grass around him. ... The screaming had stopped, the  cold was ebbing away. . . .   Something was driving the dementors back. ... It was  circling around him and Black and Hermione. ... They  were leaving. ... The air was warm again. ...   With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry  raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid  the light, galloping away across the lake. ... Eyes  blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it  was. ... It was as bright as a unicorn. ... Fighting to  stay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it  reached the opposite shore. For a moment, Harry  saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back  . . . raising his hand to pat it . . . someone who looked  strangely familiar ... but it couldn’t be ...   Harry didn’t understand. He couldn’t think anymore.  He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head  hit the ground as he fainted HERMIONE’S “Shocking business ... shocking ... miracle none of  them died . . . never heard the like ... by thunder, it  was lucky you were there, Snape. ...”   “Thank you, Minister.”   “Order of Merlin, Second Class, I’d say. First Class, if  I can wangle it!”   “Thank you very much indeed, Minister.”   “Nasty cut you’ve got there. ... Black’s work, I  suppose?”   “As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and  Granger, Minister. ...”   “iVo!”   “Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A  Confundus Charm, to judge by their behavior. They  seemed to think there was a possibility he wa innocent. They weren’t responsible for their actions.  On the other hand, their interference might have  permitted Black to escape. ... They obviously thought  they were going to catch Black single-handed. They’ve  got away with a great deal before now. ... I’m afraid  it’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves ...  and of course Potter has always been allowed an  extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster  “Ah, well, Snape ... Harry Potter, you know ... we’ve  all got a bit of a blind spot where he’s concerned.”   “And yet — is it good for him to be given so much  special treatment? Personally, I try and treat him like  any other student. And any other student would be  suspended — at the very least — for leading his  friends into such danger. Consider, Minister —  against all school rules — after all the precautions  put in place for his protection — out-of-bounds, at  night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer —  and I have reason to believe he has been visiting  Hogsmeade illegally too — ”   “Well, well ... we shall see, Snape, we shall see. ... The  boy has undoubtedly been foolish. ...”   Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt  very groggy. The words he was hearing seemed to be  traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so  that it was difficult to understand. ... His limbs felt  like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift. ... He wanted to  lie here, on this comfortable bed, forever. ...   “What amazes me most is the behavior of the  dementors ... you’ve really no idea what made them  retreat, Snape? “No, Minister ... by the time I had come ’round they  were heading back to their positions at the entrances “Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the gir “All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound  and gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and  brought them all straight back to the castle.”   There was a pause. Harry’s brain seemed to be  moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing  sensation grew in the pit of his stomach. ...   He opened his eyes.   Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had  removed his glasses. He was lying in the dark hospital  wing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out  Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a  bed. Harry squinted. Ron’s red hair was visible  beneath Madam Pomfrey’s arm.   Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed  to his right lay Hermione. Moonlight was falling  across her bed. Her eyes were open too. She looked  petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake,  pressed a finger to her lips, then pointed to the  hospital wing door. It was ajar, and the voices of  Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it  from the corridor outside.   Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the  dark ward to Harry’s bed. He turned to look at her.  She was carrying the largest block of chocolate he  had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small  boulder “Ah, you’re awake!” she said briskly. She placed the  chocolate on Harry’s bedside table and began  breaking it apart with a small hammer.   “How’s Ron?” said Harry and Hermione together.   “He’ll live,” said Madam Pomfrey grimly. “As for you  two ... you’ll be staying here until I’m satisfied you’re  — Potter, what do you think you’re doing?”   Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and  picking up his wand.   “I need to see the headmaster,” he said.   “Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, “it’s all  right. They’ve got Black. He’s locked away upstairs.  The dementors will be performing the kiss any  moment now — ”   “WHAT?”   Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the  same. But his shout had been heard in the corridor  outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and Snape had  entered the ward.   “Harry, Harry, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking  agitated. “You should be in bed — has he had any  chocolate?” he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously.   “Minister, listen!” Harry said. “Sirius Black’s innocent!  Peter Pettigrew faked his own death! We saw him  tonight! You can’t let the dementors do that thing to  Sirius, he’s — ”   But Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile  on his face “Harry, Harry, you’re very confused, you’ve been  through a dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we’ve  got everything under control. ...”   “YOU HAVEN’T!” Harry yelled. “YOU VE GOT THE  WRONG MAN!”   “Minister, listen, please,” Hermione said; she had  hurried to Harry’s side and was gazing imploringly  into Fudge’s face. “I saw him too. It was Ron’s rat,  he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and — ”   “You see, Minister?” said Snape. “Confunded, both of  them. ... Black’s done a very good job on them. ...”   “WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED!” Harry roared.   “Minister! Professor!” said Madam Pomfrey angrily. “I  must insist that you leave. Potter is my patient, and  he should not be distressed!”   “I’m not distressed, I’m trying to tell them what  happened!” Harry said furiously. “If they’d just liste But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk  of chocolate into Harry’s mouth; he choked, and she  seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.   “Now, please, Minister, these children need care.  Please leave — ”   The door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry  swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great  difficulty and got up again.   “Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black —  “For heaven’s sake!” said Madam Pomfrey  hysterically. “Is this a hospital wing or not?  Headmaster, I must insist — ”   “My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr.  Potter and Miss Granger,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I  have just been talking to Sirius Black — ”   “I suppose he’s told you the same fairy tale he’s  planted in Potter’s mind?” spat Snape. “Something  about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive — ”   “That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said Dumbledore,  surveying Snape closely through his half-moon  spectacles.   “And does my evidence count for nothing?” snarled  Snape. “Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking  Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds.”   “That was because you were knocked out, Professor!”  said Hermione earnestly. “You didn’t arrive in time to  hear — ”   “Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!”   “Now, Snape,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is  disturbed in her mind, we must make allowances — ”   “I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,”  said Dumbledore abruptly. “Cornelius, Severus,   Poppy — please leave us.”   “Headmaster!” sputtered Madam Pomfrey “They need  treatment, they need rest — ”   “This cannot wait,” said Dumbledore. “I must insist. Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into  her office at the end of the ward, slamming the door  behind her. Fudge consulted the large gold pocket  watch dangling from his waistcoat.   “The dementors should have arrived by now,” he said.  “Ill go and meet them. Dumbledore, 111 see you  upstairs.”   He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape,  but Snape hadn’t moved.   “You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?”  Snape whispered, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore ’s  face.   “I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,”  Dumbledore repeated.   Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.   “Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the  age of sixteen,” he breathed. “You haven’t forgotten  that, Headmaster? You haven’t forgotten that he once  tried to kill me?”   “My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,” said  Dumbledore quietly.   Snape turned on his heel and marched through the  door Fudge was still holding. It closed behind them,  and Dumbledore turned to Harry and Hermione. They  both burst into speech at the same time.   “Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we saw  Pettigrew — ”   “ — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a  werewolf —  “ — he’s a rat —  “ — Pettigrew’s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it of “ — Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn’t Sirius — ”   But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of  explanations.   “It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not  interrupt me, because there is very little time,” he  said quietly. “There is not a shred of proof to support  Black’s story, except your word — and the word of  two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince  anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw  Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the  Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters’ Secret-  Keeper.”   “Professor Lupin can tell you — ” Harry said, unable to  stop himself.   “Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest,  unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is  human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse  than dead. I might add that werewolves are so  mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will  count for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius  are old friends — ”   “But — ”   “ Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand  me? You must see that Professor Snape’s version of  events is far more convincing than yours.”   “He hates Sirius,” Hermione said desperately. “All  because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him —  “Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The  attack on the Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor Tower  with a knife — without Pettigrew, alive or dead, we  have no chance of overturning Sirius’s sentence.”   “But you believe us.”   “Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore quietly. “But I have no  power to make other men see the truth, or to overrule  the Minister of Magic. ...”   Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though  the ground beneath him were falling sharply away. He  had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could  solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull  some amazing solution out of the air. But no . . . their  last hope was gone.   “What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his  light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, “is  more time.”   “But — ” Hermione began. And then her eyes became  very round. “OH!”   “Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very  low, and very clearly. “Sirius is locked in Professor  Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor. Thirteenth  window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes  well, you will be able to save more than one innocent  life tonight. But remember this, both of you: you must  not be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law — you  know what is at stake. ... You — must — not — be —  seen.”   Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.  Dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back  as he reached the door “I am going to lock you in. It is — ” he consulted his  watch, “five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three  turns should do it. Good luck.”   “Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed  behind Dumbledore. “Three turns? What’s he talking  about? What are we supposed to do?”   But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her  robes, pulling from beneath them a very long, very  fine gold chain.   “Harry, come here,” she said urgently. “Quick).”   Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She  was holding the chain out. He saw a tiny, sparkling  hourglass hanging from it.   “Here — ”   She had thrown the chain around his neck too.   “Ready?” she said breathlessly.   “What are we doing?” Harry said, completely lost.   Hermione turned the hourglass over three times.   The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation  that he was flying very fast, backward. A blur of  colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears were  pounding, he tried to yell but couldn’t hear his own  voice —   And then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and  everything came into focus again —   He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted  entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight wa falling across the paved floor from the open front  doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the  chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck.   “Hermione, what — ?”   “In here!” Hermione seized Harry’s arm and dragged  him across the hall to the door of a broom closet; she  opened it, pushed him inside among the buckets and  mops, then slammed the door behind them.   “What — how — Hermione, what happened?”   “We’ve gone back in time,” Hermione whispered,  lifting the chain off Harry’s neck in the darkness.  “Three hours back ...”   Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard  pinch. It hurt a lot, which seemed to rule out the  possibility that he was having a very bizarre dream.   “But — ”   “Shh! Listen! Someone’s coming! I think — I think it  might be us!”   Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard  door.   “Footsteps across the hall ... yes, I think it’s us going  down to Hagrid’s!”   “Are you telling me,” Harry whispered, “that we’re  here in this cupboard and we’re out there too?”   “Yes,” said Hermione, her ear still glued to the  cupboard door. “I’m sure it’s us. It doesn’t sound like  more than three people ... and we’re walking slowly  because we’re under the Invisibility Cloak —  She broke off, still listening intently “We’ve gone down the front steps. ...”   Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking  desperately anxious, but Harry wanted a few  questions answered.   “Where did you get that hourglass thing?”   “It’s called a Time-Turner,” Hermione whispered, “and  I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day  back. I’ve been using it all year to get to all my  lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I  wouldn’t tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of  letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one.  She had to tell them that I was a model student, and  that I’d never, ever use it for anything except my  studies. ... I’ve been turning it back so I could do  hours over again, that’s how I’ve been doing several  lessons at once, see? But ...   “Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us  to do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours?   How’s that going to help Sirius?”   Harry stared at her shadowy face.   “There must be something that happened around now  he wants us to change,” he said slowly. “What  happened? We were walking down to Hagrid’s three  hours ago. ...”   “This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to  Hagrid’s,” said Hermione. “We just heard ourselves  leaving. ...”   Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up  his whole brain in concentration “Dumbledore just said — just said we could save  more than one innocent life. ...” And then it hit him.  “Hermione, we’re going to save Buckbeak!”   “But — how will that help Sirius?”   “Dumbledore said — he just told us where the  window is — the window of Flitwick’s office! Where  they’ve got Sirius locked up! We’ve got to fly  Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius  can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together!”   From what Harry could see of Hermione’s face, she  looked terrified.   “If we manage that without being seen, it’ll be a  miracle!”   “Well, we’ve got to try, haven’t we?” said Harry. He  stood up and pressed his ear against the door.   “Doesn’t sound like anyone’s there. ... Come on, let’s   go. ...”   Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall  was deserted. As quietly and quickly as they could,  they darted out of the closet and down the stone  steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the  tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once  more with gold.   “If anyone’s looking out of the window — ” Hermione  squeaked, looking up at the castle behind them.   “Well run for it,” said Harry determinedly. “Straight  into the forest, all right? We’ll have to hide behind a  tree or something and keep a lookout —  “Okay, but well go around by the greenhouses!” said  Hermione breathlessly. “We need to keep out of sight  of Hagrid’s front door, or well see us! We must be  nearly at Hagrid’s by now!”   Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a  sprint, Hermione behind him. They tore across the  vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a  moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they  could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing  toward the shelter of the forest. ...   Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned  around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him,  panting.   “Right,” she gasped. “We need to sneak over to  Hagrid’s. ... Keep out of sight, Harry. ...”   They made their way silently through the trees,  keeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as they  glimpsed the front of Hagrid’s house, they heard a  knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a  wide oak trunk and peered out from either side.   Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and  white, looking around to see who had knocked. And  Harry heard his own voice.   “It’s us. We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in  and we can take it off.”   “Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered. He stood  back, then shut the door quickly.   “This is the weirdest thing we’ve ever done,” Harry  said fervently.   “Let’s move along a bit,” Hermione whispered. “We  need to get nearer to Buckbeak! They crept through the trees until they saw the  nervous hippogriff, tethered to the fence around  Hagrid’s pumpkin patch.   “Now?” Harry whispered.   “No!” said Hermione. “If we steal him now, those  Committee people will think Hagrid set him free!   We’ve got to wait until they’ve seen he’s tied outside!”   “That’s going to give us about sixty seconds,” said  Harry. This was starting to seem impossible.   At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china  from inside Hagrid’s cabin.   “That’s Hagrid breaking the milk jug,” Hermione  whispered. “I’m going to find Scabbers in a moment  Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard  Hermione ’s shriek of surprise.   “Hermione,” said Harry suddenly, “what if we — we  just run in there and grab Pettigrew — ”   “No!” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Don’t you  understand? We’re breaking one of the most  important wizarding laws! Nobody’s supposed to  change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we’re  seen — ”   “We’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!”   “Harry, what do you think you’d do if you saw  yourself bursting into Hagrid’s house?” said  Hermione “I’d — I’d think I’d gone mad,” said Harry, “or I’d think  there was some Dark Magic going on —  “ Exactly ! You wouldn’t understand, you might even  attack yourself! Don’t you see? Professor McGonagall  told me what awful things have happened when  wizards have meddled with time. ... Loads of them  ended up killing their past or future selves by  mistake!”   “Okay!” said Harry. “It was just an idea, I just though But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the  castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a  clear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore,  Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the  executioner were coming down the steps.   “We’re about to come out!” Hermione breathed.   And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid’s back door  opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione  walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt,  the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind  the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.   “It’s okay, Beaky, it’s okay ... ,” Hagrid said to  Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and  Hermione. “Go on. Get goin’.”   “Hagrid, we can’t — ”   “Well tell them what really happened — ”   “They can’t kill him — ”   “Go! It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’  all! Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch  throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron.   “Go quick. Don’ listen. ...”   There was a knock on Hagrid’s front door. The  execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned around  and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door  ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all  around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet  retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone ... but  the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could  now hear what was happening inside the cabin  through the back door.   “Where is the beast?” came the cold voice of Macnair.   “Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked.   Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face  appeared at Hagrid’s window, staring out at  Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.   “We — er — have to read you the official notice of  execution, Hagrid. I’ll make it quick. And then you  and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you’re  supposed to listen too, that’s procedure — ”   Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now  or never.   “Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”   As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from  behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin  patch, and approached Buckbeak.   “It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of  Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak hereafter called the condemned, shall be executed on  the sixth of June at sundown — ”   Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s  fierce orange eyes once more and bowed. Buckbeak  sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again.  Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying  Buckbeak to the fence.   \"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried  out by the Committee’s appointed executioner, Walden  Macnair ...”   “Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on,  we’re going to help you. Quietly ... quietly ...”   \"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here. ...”   Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but  Buckbeak had dug in his front feet.   “Well, let’s get this over with,” said the reedy voice of  the Committee member from inside Hagrid’s cabin.  “Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside — ”   “No, I — I wan’ ter be with him. ... I don’ wan’ him ter  be alone — ”   Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.   “Buckbeak, move\\” Harry hissed.   Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s  neck. The hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings  irritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest,  in plain view of Hagrid’s back door.   “One moment, please, Macnair,” came Dumbledore’s  voice. “You need to sign too.” The footsteps stopped Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his  beak and walked a little faster Hermione ’s white face was sticking out from behind a  tree.   “Harry, hurry!” she mouthed.   Harry could still hear Dumbledore’s voice talking from  within the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench.  Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had  reached the trees. ...   “Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from  behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her  weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked  over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight;  they couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.   “Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear  us —  Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry,  Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the  hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.   Silence . . . then —   “Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee  member. “Where is the beast?”   “It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I  saw it! Just here!”   “How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a  note of amusement in his voice.   “Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe.  The executioner seemed to have swung it into the  fence in anger. And then came the howling, and this  time they could hear Hagrid ’s words through his sobs.   “Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he’s gone\\ Musta  pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!”   Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to  get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened  their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to  stop him.   “Someone untied him!” the executioner was snarling.  “We should search the grounds, the forest — ”   “Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you  really think the thief will have led him away on foot?”  said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. “Search the  skies, if you will. ... Hagrid, I could do with a cup of  tea. Or a large brandy.”   “O’ — o’ course, Professor,” said Hagrid, who sounded  weak with happiness. “Come in, come in. ...”   Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard  footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the  snap of the door, and then silence once more.   “Now what?” whispered Harry, looking around.   “Well have to hide in here,” said Hermione, who  looked very shaken. “We need to wait until they’ve  gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it’s safe to  fly Buckbeak up to Sirius’s window. He won’t be there  for another couple of hours. ... Oh, this is going to be  difficult. ... She looked nervously over her shoulder into the  depths of the forest. The sun was setting now.   “We’re going to have to move,” said Harry, thinking  hard. “We’ve got to be able to see the Whomping  Willow, or we won’t know what’s going on.”   “Okay,” said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on  Buckbeak’s rope. “But we’ve got to keep out of sight,  Harry, remember. ...”   They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness  falling thickly around them, until they were hidden  behind a clump of trees through which they could  make out the Willow.   “There’s Ron!” said Harry suddenly.   A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its  shout echoed through the still night air.   “Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come  here — ”   And then they saw two more figures materialize out of  nowhere. Harry watched himself and Hermione  chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.   “Gotchcd Get off, you stinking cat — ”   “There’s Sirius!” said Harry. The great shape of the  dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow.  They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize Ron. ...   “Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said Harry,  watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots. “Ouch —  look, I just got walloped by the tree — and so did you  — this is weird —  The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out  with its lower branches; they could see themselves  darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And  then the tree froze.   “That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,” said  Hermione.   “And there we go ... ,” Harry muttered. “We’re in.”   The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move  again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close  by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old  Committee member were making their way up to the  castle.   “Right after we’d gone down into the passage!” said  Hermione. “If only Dumbledore had come with us ...”   “Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said Harry  bitterly. “I bet you anything Fudge would’ve told  Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot. ...”   They watched the four men climb the castle steps and  disappear from view. For a few minutes the scene was  deserted. Then —   “Here comes Lupin!” said Harry as they saw another  figure sprinting down the stone steps and haring  toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds  were obscuring the moon completely.   They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the  ground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree  stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the  gap in its roots.   “If he’d only grabbed the cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just  lying there. ... He turned to Hermione “If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d  never be able to get it and — ”   “Harry, we mustn’t be seen!”   “How can you stand this?” he asked Hermione  fiercely. “Just standing here and watching it happen?”  He hesitated. “I’m going to grab the cloak!”   “Harry, no!”   Hermione seized the back of Harry’s robes not a  moment too soon. Just then, they heard a burst of  song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle,  singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as  he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his  hands.   “See?” Hermione whispered. “See what would have  happened? We’ve got to keep out of sight! No,  Buckbeak).”   The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to  Hagrid again; Harry seized his rope too, straining to  hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid meander  tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak  stopped fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.   Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open  yet again, and Snape came charging out of them,  running toward the Willow.   Harry’s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to  a halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed  the cloak and held it up “Get your filthy hands off it,” Harry snarled under his  breath.   “Shh!”   Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the  tree, prodded the knot, and vanished from view as he  put on the cloak.   “So that’s it,” said Hermione quietly. “We’re all down  there ... and now we’ve just got to wait until we come  back up again. ...”   She took the end of Buckbeak’s rope and tied it  securely around the nearest tree, then sat down on  the dry ground, arms around her knees.   “Harry, there’s something I don’t understand. ... Why  didn’t the dementors get Sirius? I remember them  coming, and then I think I passed out . . . there were  so many of them. ...”   Harry sat down too. He explained what he’d seen;  how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth  to Harry’s, a large silver something had come  galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to  retreat.   Hermione ’s mouth was slightly open by the time  Harry had finished.   “But what was it?”   “There’s only one thing it could have been, to make  the dementors go,” said Harry. “A real Patronus. A  powerful one.”   “But who conjured it? Harry didn’t say anything. He was thinking back to  the person he’d seen on the other bank of the lake. He  knew who he thought it had been . . . but how could it  have been?   “Didn’t you see what they looked like?” said Hermione  eagerly. “Was it one of the teachers?”   “No,” said Harry. “He wasn’t a teacher.”   “But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to  drive all those dementors away. ... If the Patronus  was shining so brightly, didn’t it light him up?  Couldn’t you see — ?”   “Yeah, I saw him,” said Harry slowly. “But ... maybe I  imagined it. ... I wasn’t thinking straight. ... I passed  out right afterward. ...”   “ Who did you think it was?”   “I think — ” Harry swallowed, knowing how strange  this was going to sound. “I think it was my dad.”   Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her  mouth was fully open now. She was gazing at him  with a mixture of alarm and pity.   “Harry, your dad’s — well — dead,” she said quietly.   “I know that,” said Harry quickly.   “You think you saw his ghost?”   “I don’t know ... no ... he looked solid. ...”   “But then —  “Maybe I was seeing things,” said Harry. “But ... from  what I could see ... it looked like him. ... I’ve got  photos of him. ...”   Hermione was still looking at him as though worried  about his sanity.   “I know it sounds crazy,” said Harry flatly. He turned  to look at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into  the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he  wasn’t really watching Buckbeak.   He was thinking about his father and about his  father’s three oldest friends ... Moony, Wormtail,  Padfoot, and Prongs. ... Had all four of them been out  on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared  this evening when everyone had thought he was dead.  ... Was it so impossible his father had done the same?  Had he been seeing things across the lake? The figure  had been too far away to see distinctly . . . yet he had  felt sure, for a moment, before he’d lost  consciousness. ...   The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The  moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting  clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the  Willow, waiting.   And then, at last, after over an hour . . .   “Here we come!” Hermione whispered.   She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his  head. They saw Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambering  awkwardly out of the hole in the roots . . . followed by  the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next  came Harry, Hermione, and Black. They all began to  walk toward the castle Harry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He  glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud  was going to move aside and show the moon. ...   “Harry,” Hermione muttered as though she knew  exactly what he was thinking, “we’ve got to stay put.  We mustn’t be seen. There’s nothing we can do. ...”   “So we’re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over  again. ...” said Harry quietly.   “How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?”  snapped Hermione. “There’s nothing we can do! We  came back to help Sirius; we’re not supposed to be  doing anything else!”   “ All right'.”   The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw  the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they  saw movement —   “There goes Lupin,” Hermione whispered. “He’s  transforming — ”   “Hermione!” said Harry suddenly. “We’ve got to move!”   “We mustn’t, I keep telling you — ”   “Not to interfere! Lupin’s going to run into the forest,  right at us!”   Hermione gasped.   “Quick!” she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak.  “Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going  to hide? The dementors will be coming any moment  “Back to Hagrid’s!” Harry said. “It’s empty now —  come on!”   They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering  along behind them. They could hear the werewolf  howling behind them. ...   The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door,  wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak  flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them  and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked  loudly.   “Shh, Fang, it’s us!” said Hermione, hurrying over and  scratching his ears to quieten him. “That was really  close!” she said to Harry.   “Yeah ...”   Harry was looking out of the window. It was much  harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak  seemed very happy to find himself back inside  Hagrid’s house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded  his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good  nap.   “I think I’d better go outside again, you know,” said  Harry slowly. “I can’t see what’s going on — we won’t  know when it’s time — ”   Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.   “I’m not going to try and interfere,” said Harry  quickly. “But if we don’t see what’s going on, how’re  we going to know when it’s time to rescue Sirius?”   “Well ... okay, then ... I’ll wait here with Buckbeak ...  but Harry, be careful — there’s a werewolf out there  — and the dementors —  Harry stepped outside again and edged around the  cabin. He could hear yelping in the distance. That  meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius. ... He  and Hermione would be running to him any moment Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a  kind of drumroll in his chest. ... Whoever had sent  that Patronus would be appearing at any moment. ...   For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front  of Hagrid’s door. You must not be seen. But he didn’t  want to be seen. He wanted to do the seeing. ... He  had to know. . . .   And there were the dementors. They were emerging  out of the darkness from every direction, gliding  around the edges of the lake. ... They were moving  away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.   ... He wouldn’t have to get near them. ...   Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head  except his father. ... If it was him ... if it really was  him ... he had to know, had to find out. ...   The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there  was no sign of anybody. On the opposite bank, he  could see tiny glimmers of silver — his own attempts  at a Patronus —   There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry  threw himself behind it, peering desperately through  the leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of  silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified  excitement shot through him — any moment now —   “Come on!” he muttered, staring about. “Where are  you? Dad, come on —  But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the  circle of dementors across the lake. One of them was  lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to  appear — but no one was coming to help this time —   And then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen  his father — he had seen himself —   Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and  pulled out his wand.   “EXPECTO PATRONUM ” he yelled.   And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless  cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal.  He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It  looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away  from him, across the black surface of the lake. He  saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming  dementors. ... Now it was galloping around and  around the black shapes on the ground, and the  dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating  into the darkness. ... They were gone.   The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward  Harry across the still surface of the water. It wasn’t a  horse. It wasn’t a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was  shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming  back to him. ...   It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on  the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large,  silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. And  Harry realized . . .   “Prongs,” he whispered.   But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the  creature, it vanished Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with  a great leap of his heart, he heard hooves behind him  — he whirled around and saw Hermione dashing  toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.   “What did you do?” she said fiercely. “You said you  were only going to keep a lookout!”   “I just saved all our lives ... ,” said Harry. “Get behind  here — behind this bush — I’ll explain.”   Hermione listened to what had just happened with  her mouth open yet again.   “Did anyone see you?”   “Yes, haven’t you been listening? I saw me but I  thought I was my dad! It’s okay!”   “Harry, I can’t believe it. ... You conjured up a  Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That’s  very, very advanced magic. ...”   “I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because  I’d already done it. ... Does that make sense?”   “I don’t know — Harry, look at Snape!”   Together they peered around the bush at the other  bank. Snape had regained consciousness. He was  conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of  Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth  stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating  at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he  moved them away toward the castle.   “Right, it’s nearly time,” said Hermione tensely,  looking at her watch. “We’ve got about forty-five  minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to th hospital wing. We’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back  into the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in  the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in  the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms  again.   “D’you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry,  checking his watch. He looked up at the castle and  began counting the windows to the right of the West  Tower.   “Look!” Hermione whispered. “Who’s that? Someone’s  coming back out of the castle!”   Harry stared through the darkness. The man was  hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the  entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt.   “Macnair!” said Harry. “The executioner! He’s gone to  get the dementors! This is it, Hermione — ”   Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak’s back and  Harry gave her a leg up. Then he placed his foot on  one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up  in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over  his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like  reins.   “Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better  hold on to me — ”   He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.   Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry  gripped his flanks with his knees, feeling the great  wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione wa holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could  hear her muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this — oh, I  really don’t like this — ”   Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding  quietly toward the upper floors of the castle. ... Harry  pulled hard on the left-hand side of the rope, and  Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the  windows flashing past —   “Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he  could.   Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at  a stop, unless you counted the fact that they kept  rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat  his wings to remain airborne.   “He’s there!” Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose  up beside the window. He reached out, and as  Buckbeak’s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the  glass.   Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt  from his chair, hurried to the window and tried to  open it, but it was locked.   “Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took  out her wand, still gripping the back of Harry’s robes  with her left hand.   “Alohomoral”   The window sprang open.   “How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the  hippogriff “Get on — there’s not much time,” said Harry,  gripping Buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek  neck to hold him steady. “You’ve got to get out of here   — the dementors are coming — Macnair’s gone to get  them.”   Black placed a hand on either side of the window  frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it. It  was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he had  managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak’s back and  pull himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.   “Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope.  “Up to the tower — come on!”   The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and  they were soaring upward again, high as the top of  the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a clatter on  the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him  at once.   “Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll  reach Flitwick’s office any moment, they’ll find out  you’re gone.”   Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.   “What happened to the other boy? Ron?” croaked  Sirius.   “He’s going to be okay. He’s still out of it, but Madam  Pomfrey says shell be able to make him better. Quick   - g But Black was still staring down at Harry.   “How can I ever thank — ”   “GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.   “Well see each other again,” he said. “You are — truly  your father’s son, Harry. ...”   He squeezed Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Harry  and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings  rose once more. ... The hippogriff took off into the air.   . . . He and his rider became smaller and smaller as  Harry gazed after them ... then a cloud drifted across  the moon. ... They were gone “Harry!”   Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her  watch. “We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back  down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us  — before Dumbledore locks the door — ”   “Okay,” said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky,  “let’s go. ...”   They slipped through the doorway behind them and  down a tightly spiraling stone staircase. As they  reached the bottom of it, they heard voices. They  flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It  sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking  quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase.   \"... only hope Dumbledore ’s not going to make  difficulties,” Snape was saying. “The Kiss will be  performed immediately? “As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This  whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I  can’t tell you how much I’m looking forward to  informing the Daily Prophet that we’ve got him at last.  ...I daresay they’ll want to interview you, Snape ...  and once young Harry’s back in his right mind, I  expect he’ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you  saved him. ...”   Harry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of  Snape’s smirk as he and Fudge passed Harry and  Hermione’s hiding place. Their footsteps died away.  Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make  sure they’d really gone, then started to run in the  opposite direction. Down one staircase, then another,  along a new corridor — then they heard a cackling  ahead.   “Peeves\\” Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione’s wrist.  “In here!”   They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just  in time. Peeves seemed to be bouncing along the  corridor in boisterous good spirits, laughing his head  off.   “Oh, he’s horrible,” whispered Hermione, her ear to  the door. “I bet he’s all excited because the dementors  are going to finish off Sirius. ...” She checked her  watch. “Three minutes, Harry!”   They waited until Peeves ’s gloating voice had faded  into the distance, then slid back out of the room and  broke into a run again.   “Hermione — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back  inside — before Dumbledore locks the door?” Harry  panted “I don’t want to think about it!” Hermione moaned,  checking her watch again. “One minute!”   They had reached the end of the corridor with the  hospital wing entrance. “Okay — I can hear  Dumbledore,” said Hermione tensely. “Come on,  Harry!”   They crept along the corridor. The door opened.  Dumbledore ’s back appeared.   “I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying. “It  is five minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns  should do it. Good luck.”   Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door,  and took out his wand to magically lock it. Panicking,  Harry and Hermione ran forward. Dumbledore looked  up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver  mustache. “Well?” he said quietly.   “We did it!” said Harry breathlessly. “Sirius has gone,  on Buckbeak. ...”   Dumbledore beamed at them.   “Well done. I think — ” He listened intently for any  sound within the hospital wing. “Yes, I think you’ve  gone too — get inside — I’ll lock you in — ”   Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the  dormitory. It was empty except for Ron, who was still  lying motionless in the end bed. As the lock clicked  behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their  own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back  under her robes. A moment later, Madam Pomfrey  came striding back out of her office “Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to  look after my patients now?”   She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione  thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly.  Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they  ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and  Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves  jangling. ... And then, as they both took a fourth piece  of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a  distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above  them. ...   “What was that?” said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.   Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and  louder. Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door.   “Really — they’ll wake everybody up! What do they  think they’re doing?”   Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying.  They were drawing nearer —   “He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should  have left somebody in the room with him. When this  gets out — ”   “HE DIDNT DISAPPARATE!” Snape roared, now very  close at hand. “YOU CANT APPARATE OR  DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS — HAS —  SOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER!”   “Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked  up-”   BAM.   The door of the hospital wing burst open Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the  ward. Dumbledore alone looked calm. Indeed, he  looked as though he was quite enjoying himself.   Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.   “OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID  YOU DO?”   “Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey. “Control  yourself!”   “See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This  door’s been locked, we just saw — ”   “THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape  howled, pointing at Harry and Hermione. His face was  twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.   “Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking  nonsense!”   “YOU DONT KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE  DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT — ”   “That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly.  “Think about what you are saying. This door has been  locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam  Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?”   “Of course not!” said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. “I  would have heard them!”   “Well, there you have it, Severus,” said Dumbledore  calmly. “Unless you are suggesting that Harry and  Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I’m  afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.”   Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who  looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, t Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his  glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind  him, and stormed out of the ward.   “Fellow seems quite unbalanced,” said Fudge, staring  after him. “I’d watch out for him if I were you,  Dumbledore.”   “Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said Dumbledore quietly.  “He’s just suffered a severe disappointment.”   “He’s not the only one!” puffed Fudge. “The Daily  Prophet’s going to have a field day! We had Black  cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet  again! All it needs now is for the story of that  hippogriff’s escape to get out, and I’ll be a  laughingstock! Well ... I’d better go and notify the  Ministry. ...”   “And the dementors?” said Dumbledore. “They’ll be  removed from the school, I trust?”   “Oh yes, they’ll have to go,” said Fudge, running his  fingers distractedly through his hair. “Never dreamed  they’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent  boy. ... Completely out of control ... no, I’ll have them  packed off back to Azkaban tonight. ... Perhaps we  should think about dragons at the school entrance “Hagrid would like that,” said Dumbledore, smiling at  Harry and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the  dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to the door and  locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she  headed back to her office.   There was a low moan from the other end of the ward.  Ron had woken up. They could see him sitting up,  rubbing his head, looking around “What — what happened?” he groaned. “Harry? Why  are we in here? Where’s Sirius? Where’s Lupin?   What’s going on?”   Harry and Hermione looked at each other.   “You explain,” said Harry, helping himself to some  more chocolate.   When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital  wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost  deserted castle. The sweltering heat and the end of  the exams meant that everyone was taking full  advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron  nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and  Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about  the extraordinary events of the previous night and  wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.  Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving  its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the  thread of the conversation as he looked across to the  opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him  from there just last night. ...   A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a  very bleary-eyed Hagrid, mopping his sweaty face with  one of his tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs and  beaming down at them.   “Know I shouldn’ feel happy, after wha’ happened las’  night,” he said. “I mean, Black escapin’ again, an’  everythin’ — but guess what?”   “What?” they said, pretending to look curious.   “Beaky! He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all  night! “That’s wonderful!” said Hermione, giving Ron a  reproving look because he looked as though he was  close to laughing.   “Yeah ... can’t’ve tied him up properly,” said Hagrid,  gazing happily out over the grounds. “I was worried  this mornin’, mind ... thought he mighta met  Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he  never ate anythin’ las’ night. ...”   “What?” said Harry quickly.   “Blimey, haven’ yeh heard?” said Hagrid, his smile  fading a little. He lowered his voice, even though there  was nobody in sight. “Er — Snape told all the  Slytherins this mornin’. ... Thought everyone ’d know  by now ... Professor Lupin’s a werewolf, see. An’ he  was loose on the grounds las’ night. ... He’s packin’  now, o’ course.”   “He’s packing?” said Harry, alarmed. “Why?”   “Leavin’, isn’ he?” said Hagrid, looking surprised that  Harry had to ask. “Resigned firs’ thing this mornin’.  Says he can’t risk it happenin’ again.”   Harry scrambled to his feet.   “I’m going to see him,” he said to Ron and Hermione.  “But if he’s resigned — ”   “ — doesn’t sound like there’s anything we can do — ”   “I don’t care. I still want to see him. I’ll meet you back  here.”   Lupin’s office door was open. He had already packed  most of his things. The grindylow’s empty tank stoo next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and  nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his  desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the  door.   “I saw you coming,” said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to  the parchment he had been poring over. It was the  Marauder’s Map.   “I just saw Hagrid,” said Harry. “And he said you’d  resigned. It’s not true, is it?”   “I’m afraid it is,” said Lupin. He started opening his  desk drawers and taking out the contents.   “Why?” said Harry. “The Ministry of Magic don’t think  you were helping Sirius, do they?”   Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.   “No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince  Fudge that I was trying to save your lives.” He sighed.  “That was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss  of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he — er —  accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning  at breakfast.”   “You’re not leaving just because of that!” said Harry.  Lupin smiled wryly.   “This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from  parents. ... They will not want a werewolf teaching  their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their  point. I could have bitten any of you. ... That must  never happen again.”   “You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts  teacher we’ve ever had!” said Harry. “Don’t go! Lupin shook his head and didn’t speak. He carried on  emptying his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying  to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin  said, “From what the headmaster told me this  morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If  I’m proud of anything I’ve done this year, it’s how  much you’ve learned. ... Tell me about your  Patronus.”   “How d’you know about that?” said Harry, distracted.   “What else could have driven the dementors back?”   Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he’d  finished, Lupin was smiling again.   “Yes, your father was always a stag when he  transformed,” he said. “You guessed right ... that’s  why we called him Prongs.”   Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed  the desk drawers, and turned to look at Harry.   “Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last  night,” he said, handing Harry back the Invisibility  Cloak. “And ...” He hesitated, then held out the  Marauder’s Map too. “I am no longer your teacher, so  I don’t feel guilty about giving you back this as well.  It’s no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and  Hermione will find uses for it.”   Harry took the map and grinned.   “You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs  would’ve wanted to lure me out of school ... you said  they’d have thought it was funny.”   “And so we would have,” said Lupin, now reaching  down to close his case. “I have no hesitation in sayin that James would have been highly disappointed if  his son had never found any of the secret passages  out of the castle.”   There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed  the Marauder’s Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his  pocket.   It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn’t look surprised  to see Harry there.   “Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said.   “Thank you, Headmaster.”   Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty  grindylow tank.   “Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has  been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we’ll  meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need  to see me to the gates, I can manage. ...”   Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave  as quickly as possible.   “Good-bye, then, Remus,” said Dumbledore soberly.  Lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he  and Dumbledore could shake hands. Then, with a  final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the  office.   Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at  the floor. He heard the door close and looked up.  Dumbledore was still there.   “Why so miserable, Harry?” he said quietly. “You  should be very proud of yourself after last night. “It didn’t make any difference,” said Harry bitterly.  “Pettigrew got away.”   “Didn’t make any difference?” said Dumbledore  quietly. “It made all the difference in the world, Harry.  You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent  man from a terrible fate.”   Terrible. Something stirred in Harry’s memory.   Greater and more terrible than ever before ... Professor  Trelawney’s prediction!   “Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was  having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went  very — very strange.”   “Indeed?” said Dumbledore. “Er — stranger than  usual, you mean?”   “Yes . . . her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled  and she said ... she said Voldemort’s servant was  going to set out to return to him before midnight. ...  She said the servant would help him come back to  power.” Harry stared up at Dumbledore. “And then  she sort of became normal again, and she couldn’t  remember anything she’d said. Was it — was she  making a real prediction?”   Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.   “Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,”  he said thoughtfully. “Who’d have thought it? That  brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should  offer her a pay raise. ...”   “But — ” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could  Dumbledore take this so calmly “But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from  killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort  comes back! “It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your  experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything,  Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so  complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a  very difficult business indeed. ... Professor Trelawney,  bless her, is living proof of that. ... You did a very  noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.”   “But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !”   “Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent  Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt. ... When one  wizard saves another wizard’s life, it creates a certain  bond between them ... and I’m much mistaken if  Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry  Potter.”   “I don’t want a connection with Pettigrew!” said Harry.  “He betrayed my parents!”   “This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable,  Harry. But trust me ... the time may come when you  will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.”   Harry couldn’t imagine when that would be.  Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry  was thinking.   “I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and  later, Harry,” he said gently. “He would have saved  Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.”   Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn’t laugh  — he could tell Dumbledore . .  “I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my  Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake  ...I thought I was seeing him.”   “An easy mistake to make,” said Dumbledore softly. “I  expect you 11 tire of hearing it, but you do look  extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes ... you  have your mother’s eyes.”   Harry shook his head.   “It was stupid, thinking it was him,” he muttered. “I  mean, I knew he was dead.”   “You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You  think that we don’t recall them more clearly than ever  in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you,  Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have  need of him. How else could you produce that  particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.”   It took a moment for Harry to realize what  Dumbledore had said.   “Last night Sirius told me all about how they became  Animagi,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “An  extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it  quiet from me. And then I remembered the most  unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged  Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against  Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see  your father last night. ... You found him inside  yourself.”   And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his  very confused thoughts Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had  happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and  Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione,  and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term  approached, Harry heard many different theories  about what had really happened, but none of them  came close to the truth.   Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was  convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling  the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he  and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper.  Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the  subject of Sirius’s escape.   “If I manage to get into the Ministry, I’ll have a lot of  proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement!”  he told the only person who would listen — his  girlfriend, Penelope.   Though the weather was perfect, though the  atmosphere was so cheerful, though he knew they  had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to  freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a  school year in worse spirits.   He certainly wasn’t the only one who was sorry to see  Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry’s Defense  Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his  resignation.   “Wonder what they’ll give us next year?” said Seamus  Finnigan gloomily.   “Maybe a vampire,” suggested Dean Thomas  hopefully.   It wasn’t only Professor Lupin’s departure that was  weighing on Harry’s mind. He couldn’t help thinking  lot about Professor Trelawney’s prediction. He kept  wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had  sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing  that was lowering Harry’s spirits most of all was the  prospect of returning to the Dursleys. For maybe half  an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he  would be living with Sirius from now on . . . his  parents’ best friend. ... It would have been the next  best thing to having his own father back. And while  no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it  meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry  couldn’t help feeling miserable when he thought of  the home he might have had, and the fact that it was  now impossible.   The exam results came out on the last day of term.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione had passed every subject.  Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions.  He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might  have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose.  Snape’s behavior toward Harry over the past week  had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn’t have  thought it possible that Snape’s dislike for him could  increase, but it certainly had. A muscle twitched  unpleasantly at the corner of Snape’s thin mouth  every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly  flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them  around Harry’s throat.   Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and  George had scraped a handful of O.W.L.s each.  Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to their  spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had  won the House championship for the third year  running. This meant that the end of term feast took  place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that  the Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as  everybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forge about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day  as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the  next morning, Hermione gave Harry and Ron some  surprising news.   “I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just  before breakfast. I’ve decided to drop Muggle Studies.”   “But you passed your exam with three hundred and  twenty percent!” said Ron.   “I know,” sighed Hermione, “but I can’t stand another  year like this one. That Time-Turner, it was driving  me mad. I’ve handed it in. Without Muggle Studies  and Divination, I’ll be able to have a normal schedule  again.”   “I still can’t believe you didn’t tell us about it,” said  Ron grumpily. “We’re supposed to be your friends.”   “I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone,” said Hermione  severely. She looked around at Harry, who was  watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a  mountain. Two whole months before he’d see it again “Oh, cheer up, Harry!” said Hermione sadly.   “I’m okay,” said Harry quickly. “Just thinking about  the holidays.”   “Yeah, I’ve been thinking about them too,” said Ron.  “Harry, you’ve got to come and stay with us. I’ll fix it  up with Mum and Dad, then I’ll call you. I know how  to use a fellytone now —  “A telephone, Ron,” said Hermione. “Honestly, you  should take Muggle Studies next year. ...”   Ron ignored her.   “It’s the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How  about it, Harry? Come and stay, and we’ll go and see  it! Dad can usually get tickets from work.”   This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a  great deal.   “Yeah ... I bet the Dursleys’d be pleased to let me  come ... especially after what I did to Aunt Marge. ...”   Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron  and Hermione in several games of Exploding Snap,  and when the witch with the tea cart arrived, he  bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing  with chocolate in it.   But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that  made him truly happy turned up. ...   “Harry,” said Hermione suddenly, peering over his  shoulder. “What’s that thing outside your window?”   Harry turned to look outside. Something very small  and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the  glass. He stood up for a better look and saw that it  was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too  big for it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept  tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way and that in  the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the  window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt  like a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside.  The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and began  zooming around their compartment, apparently very  pleased with itself for accomplishing its task. Hedwi clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.  Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with  his great yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the  owl safely out of harm’s way.   Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him.   He ripped open the letter, and shouted, “It’s from  Sirius!”   “What?” said Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it  aloud!”   Dear Harry,   I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and  uncle. I don’t know whether they’re used to owl post   Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in  case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some  doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could  find, and he did seem eager for the job.   I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but  they haven’t a hope of finding me here. I am planning  to allow some Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way  from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle will  be lifted.   There is something I never got around to telling you  during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the  Firebolt —   “Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I told you it  was from him!”   “Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron.  “Ouch!” The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his  hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what it  seemed to think was an affectionate way Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I  used your name but told them to take the gold from my  own Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen  birthdays’ worth of presents from your godfather.   I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I  gave you that night last year when you left your  uncle’s house. I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you  before starting my journey north, but I think the sight  of me alarmed you.   I am enclosing something else for you, which I think  will make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.   If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.   I’ll write again soon.   Sirius   Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was  another piece of parchment in there. He read it  through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and  contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot  butterbeer in one gulp.   I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give  him permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends.   “That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry  happily. He looked back at Sirius’s letter.   “Hang on, there’s a P.S. ...”   I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl,  as it’s my fault he no longer has a rat.   Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting  excitedly “Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at  the owl for a moment; then, to Harry’s and  Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for  Crookshanks to sniff.   “What do’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely  an owl?”   Crookshanks purred.   “That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s  mine.”   Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the  way back into King’s Cross station. It was still  clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and  Hermione stepped back through the barrier of  platform nine and three-quarters. Harry spotted  Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good  distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them  suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in  greeting, his worst suspicions about them seemed  confirmed.   “I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry  as Harry bid him and Hermione good-bye, then  wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig’s  cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his  usual fashion.   “What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope  Harry was still clutching in his hand. “If it’s another  form for me to sign, you’ve got another — ”   “It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my  godfather.”   “Godfather?” sputtered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t  got a godfather! “Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum  and dad’s best friend. He’s a convicted murderer, but  he’s broken out of wizard prison and he’s on the run.  He likes to keep in touch with me, though ... keep up  with my news ... check if I’m happy. ...”   And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle  Vernon’s face, Harry set off toward the station exit,  Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked  like a much better summer than the last\n"
